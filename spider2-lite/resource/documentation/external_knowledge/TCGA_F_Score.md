### Detailed Description of the ANOVA Calculation Process

The F-statistic is computed to test the null hypothesis that the means of the gene expression levels for different mutation types are equal. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the process.

#### 1. **Cohort Selection**
The cohort consists of samples from the TCGA-BRCA project, focusing on two specific datasets:
- **RNA expression data**: This dataset contains normalized expression levels of the TP53 gene.
- **Mutation data**: This dataset identifies the mutation types for the TP53 gene.

We first extract relevant samples, ensuring that only non-null and positive gene expression values are included. Each sample is assigned to a mutation type based on the corresponding mutation data.

#### 2. **Grand Mean (Overall Mean) Calculation**
The **grand mean** is the average of all gene expression values across all samples, regardless of their mutation type. This serves as the baseline for comparing how much each mutation type's mean expression deviates from the overall population mean.

Mathematically, the grand mean \( \bar{X} \) is calculated as:

\[
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of samples.
- \( X_i \) is the gene expression value of sample \( i \).

#### 3. **Group Mean Calculation**
For each mutation type (or group), we compute the **group mean**. This is the average gene expression value within that mutation type.

The group mean for mutation type \( j \) is given by:

\[
\bar{X_j} = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ji}
\]

Where:
- \( n_j \) is the number of samples in group \( j \).
- \( X_{ji} \) is the expression value of sample \( i \) in group \( j \).

#### 4. **Sum of Squares Between (SSB)**
The **between-group sum of squares (SSB)** measures how much the group means deviate from the grand mean, weighted by the number of samples in each group. This helps assess the variation between the groups (mutation types).

SSB is calculated as:

\[
SSB = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\bar{X_j} - \bar{X})^2
\]

Where:
- \( n_j \) is the number of samples in group \( j \).
- \( \bar{X_j} \) is the mean expression value for group \( j \).
- \( \bar{X} \) is the grand mean.

#### 5. **Sum of Squares Within (SSW)**
The **within-group sum of squares (SSW)** measures how much the individual sample values within each group deviate from the group mean. This reflects the variation within the groups.

SSW is calculated as:

\[
SSW = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ji} - \bar{X_j})^2
\]

Where:
- \( X_{ji} \) is the expression value of sample \( i \) in group \( j \).
- \( \bar{X_j} \) is the mean expression value for group \( j \).

#### 6. **Mean Squares (MS)**
Next, we compute the **mean squares** by dividing the sum of squares by their corresponding degrees of freedom.

- **Mean Square Between (MSB)** is the SSB divided by the degrees of freedom between groups, which is \( k - 1 \), where \( k \) is the number of groups:

\[
MSB = \frac{SSB}{k - 1}
\]

- **Mean Square Within (MSW)** is the SSW divided by the degrees of freedom within groups, which is \( n - k \), where \( n \) is the total number of samples:

\[
MSW = \frac{SSW}{n - k}
\]

#### 7. **F-Statistic Calculation**
The **F-statistic** is calculated by taking the ratio of the mean square between groups (MSB) to the mean square within groups (MSW). This ratio quantifies whether the variance between the group means is significantly larger than the variance within the groups.

The formula for the F-statistic is:

\[
F = \frac{MSB}{MSW}
\]

- A higher F value suggests that the between-group variance is much larger than the within-group variance, indicating that the group means are significantly different from each other.

#### 8. **Interpretation of the F-Statistic**
Once the F-statistic is computed, it is compared to a critical value from the F-distribution with degrees of freedom \( (k - 1, n - k) \). If the F-statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis that the group means are equal is rejected, implying that at least one mutation type has a significantly different gene expression level.
