            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \\n       1. The present invention relates generally to a fuel filter for use with internal combustion engines, for example, but not limited to diesel engines in commercial vehicles. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a fuel filter containing a fuel additive that can be released into fuel and a method of releasing the additive into the fuel.  \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       2. Fuel filters are necessary components used to protect combustion engines by filtering out contaminants and thereby preventing damage to the engine and other downstream components such as valves, fuel injectors, fuel lines and related components. Fuel can entrain a wide variety of contaminants from a number of sources. Frequently fuel oxidizes and forms resinous materials such as asphaltenes commonly referred to as varnishes. Bacteria can grow in fuel, particularly fuel that contains moisture. The growing bacteria forms a \u201cslime\u201d on inner surfaces of fuel tanks, fuel lines and fuel filters. The slime often sloughs off the surfaces and fuel transports the free slime through the fuel lines. The fuel filter filters out the varnishes and bacteria; however, in the process the varnish and bacteria block the fuel filter element. The blocked filter exhibits a reduced fuel flow and increases the pressure differential across the filter element, thereby reducing engine performance and fuel efficiency. To maintain engine performance and reliability, the fuel filters must be replaced, often as frequently as every 2,000 to 4,000 vehicle miles. For many vehicles, particularly commercial trucks that travel hundreds or even thousands of miles a month, this significantly increases vehicle maintenance and operating costs and can reduce reliability.  \\n       3. Fortunately, the formation of varnishes and bacteria growth can be inhibited by adding fuel additives such as antioxidants and biocides to the fuel. Dispersants can be added to break up and dissolve some of the existing material clogging the filters and other fuel related components. To be effective, the additives must be constantly maintained in the fuel. This is often difficult. Unlike other fluid systems, such as the coolant and oil systems, the fuel system does not re-circulate all of the fluid. Therefore, the additives must be continuously added to the fuel at a controlled rate.  \\n       4. It is difficult to maintain a constant or desired level of an additive in the fuel. Typically an operator adds a bottled additive to the vehicle fuel tank with each fuel fill-up. While many bottled fuel additives are commercially available, often operators do not consistently add the additive with each fill-up. The additive might not be readily available or the operator may forget to include the additive. When the additive is added to the fuel tank, it does not always form a homogeneous mixture with the fuel. Fuel tanks do not include reliable methods for mixing fuel. Generally operators rely upon the turbulence created during a fill-up and by vehicle motion to mix the additive and fuel. Furthermore, the additive concentration in the fuel may vary, depending upon the amount of fuel added-assuming a set amount of additive is added with each fill-up.  \\n       5. The following references provide a background for filters in general that contain additives.  \\n       6. Davis in U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,942 describes a pressurized fuel filter having an additive embedded in wax; the wax/additive composition dissolves when contacted with fuel. Additional additive is only added when a portion of the fuel becomes clogged and the fuel level in the filter rises to contact and dissolve additional amounts of the wax/additive composition.  \\n       7. Lefebvre in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,330 discloses an oil filter that includes a thermoplastic material having oil oxidation and acidification additives. The hot oil recirculating through the engine and the filter dissolves that thermoplastic material thereby releasing the additives into the oil.  \\n       8. Hudgens in U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,799 discloses a coolant filter for recirculating coolant. The coolant filter includes a supplemental coolant additive (SCA) and a release means to maintain the concentration of SCA already dissolved in the recirculating coolant fluid.  \\n       9. One of the design challenges addressed by the present invention is how to control the release of fuel additive into the fuel. The present invention solves this challenge in several ways, each of which is believed to be a novel and unobvious solution. The solution avoids the undesirable side effects, which have already been described and can be exploited to increase the maintenance interval, increase the fuel filter life span and enhance engine performance and fuel efficiency.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       10. In one form the present invention provides a fuel filter for filtering fuel and adapted to release a fuel additive into the fuel at a controlled rate. The fuel filter comprises a housing assembly including an inlet and an outlet for fuel and defining an interior chamber; a filter element disposed within the interior chamber; a source of fuel additive disposed within the interior chamber; and a slow release means for controlling the rate of release of the fuel additive into the fuel. The slow release means is positioned between the source of fuel additive and the fuel outlet.  \\n       11. In another form the present invention provides a fuel filter for filtering fuel and adapted to release a fuel additive into the fuel. The fuel filter comprises an outer housing assembly defining a filter chamber, an inlet and an outlet for fuel; a filter element disposed within the filter chamber and positioned between the inlet and the outlet for fuel; an inner housing assembly positioned within the filter chamber, the inner housing assembly defining an inner chamber in fluid communication with the filter chamber; a source of a fuel additive disposed within the inner chamber; and a diffusion controlled orifice positioned between the source of fuel additive and the fuel outlet.  \\n       12. In another form the present invention provides a method of releasing a fuel additive into fuel. The method comprises: providing a fuel filter containing a fuel additive, the fuel filter positioned between a source of fuel and an internal combustion engine; contacting a portion of the fuel additive with a portion of the fuel to provide a fuel composition comprising fuel additive; and allowing the fuel composition to admix with the fuel.  \\n       13. One object of the present invention is to provide an improved fuel filter containing a fuel additive.  \\n       14.

Upper wall portion  62  includes orifice  44 , which provides fluid communication between inner chamber  40  and inner region  37 . The upper wall portion can also include at least one, preferably two, vent openings  46 . Upper wall  62  includes an axially protruding tapered diffusion tube  48 . Diffusion tube  48  defines a tapered diffusion passageway for orifice  44 , which extends therethrough and establishes a passageway of fluid communication between the inner chamber  40  and inner region  37 .  \\n     28. Referring additionally to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a typical baffle plate  50  for use with the present invention. Cap  36  can include, but is not required to include, at least one, preferably a plurality, of baffle plates  50 . Each baffle plate  50  includes a plurality of openings  51  formed therethrough. Baffle plate  50  is spaced from diffusion tube  48 . In preferred embodiments, cap  36  includes three baffle plates  50  spaced from each other; each baffle plate individually bonded about its peripheral edge to inner surface  52  of cap  36 . It will be appreciated that in alternative forms cap  36 , which includes at least one baffle plate  50 , need not include a diffusion control orifice or the diffusion tube  48 . When thus provided, cap  36  has an opening providing fluid communication with filter chamber  12  and includes a sufficient number of baffle plates  50  to slow the flow of fuel into inner chamber  40  and/or to control the rate of release of the fuel additive. Further, a plurality of baffle plates  50  can be provided to reduce turbulence in inner chamber  44 . Preferably, each baffle plate  50  is spaced from an adjacent baffle plate to misalign the plurality of openings  51  in the adjacent baffle plates.  \\n     29. As is illustrated in FIG. 1, cap  36  seats on base plate  34  and forms an inner housing  43  assembly that defines inner chamber  40 . The only openings into inner chamber  40  are the diffusion orifice  44  and vent openings  46 . Inner chamber  40  is substantially filled with a fuel additive composition, which is illustrated in a form of a tablet  42 . It is understood that the fuel additive composition can be provided in a variety of shapes and sizes, including cubic, cylindrical, and spherical. Typically, tablets  42  are provided in a cubic shape to fill the inner chamber  40 .  \\n     30. Fuel from filter chamber  12  in filter  10  migrates through the diffusion orifice  44  into an inner chamber  40 . Fuel in inner chamber  40  contacts the outer coating  47  of fuel additive tablet  42 . Fuel then diffuses through the coating  47  to contact the fuel additive composition, which dissolves in the fuel to provide a fuel composition comprising the dissolved additive. The fuel composition diffuses back through coating  47  into inner chamber  40 . The fuel composition mixes with fuel in inner chamber  40 .  \\n     31. The fuel system is unlike the coolant and oil systems used with internal combustion engines because in some duty cycles the fuel system does not recirculate a significant portion of fluid. Therefore, under these conditions, the majority of fuel entering into filter chamber  14  has not been recirculated through filter  10  and for all practical purposes does not include any dissolved additive. While not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the concentration of dissolved additive in the fuel composition in inner chamber  40  is vastly greater than the concentration of dissolved additive in the fuel in filter chamber  14  outside inner chamber  40 . This concentration difference is significantly greater than would be expected in a recirculating fluid system. This concentration difference creates a stronger driving force for the fuel composition to migrate from inner chamber  40  into filter chamber  40 . In preferred embodiments, baffle plate  50  and/or diffusion orifice  44  are provided to inhibit or reduce the flow of fuel into and out from inner chamber  40 . This increases the useful lifespan of fuel filter  10  and controls the rate of release of the fuel additive composition into the fuel.  \\n     32. Inner chamber  40  provides a substantially quiescent region inside filter chamber  12  that does not experience the currents created by fuel flowing through filter  10 . As the concentration of dissolved fuel additive in inner chamber  40  increases relative to concentration of the fuel additive in filter chamber  12 , the fuel composition migrates or diffuses from inner chamber  40  into filter chamber  12  in an effort to achieve equilibrium. The fuel composition comprising the dissolved additive and the fuel diffuses through diffusion tube  48  and diffusion orifice  44  that defines a restricted opening for the migration of the higher concentration solution out of the inner chamber  40  and mixes with fuel in filter chamber  14 .  \\n     33. The fuel additives for use in this invention can be of liquid or solid form. Two or more fuel additives can be combined to form a fuel additive composition. The fuel additive(s) can be compounded with a suitable polymer either for providing a solid or semisolid material such as tablet  42  or form for providing a matrix to control the rate of release of the additive into the fuel. The fuel additive can further include a wide variety of binders, compounding agents and mold release agents. When the additive is provided in liquid form, it is preferable, but not required, to combine the liquid fuel additive with a suitable agent to form a solid or semisolid material. As used herein, the term fuel additive includes any commercially known and/or commonly used fuel additive that imparts beneficial properties to the fuel and/or the engine and related fuel-handling components. Common classes of fuel additives include: antioxidants, antiwear agents, cetane improvers, corrosion inhibitors, demulsifiers, detergents, dispersants, flow improvers, lubricity agents, and metal deactivators.  \\n     34. Tablets  42  of fuel additive include an outer hydrocarbon insoluble coating  47 , which encases the fuel additive composition tablet  42 . The hydrocarbon insoluble coating is selected to be substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon fuel mixtures, yet be permeable to the fuel to allow the fuel to penetrate the coating and contact the fuel additive. A portion of the fuel additive dissolves in the fuel to provide a fuel composition that includes the dissolved fuel additive. The coating may be a hard coating or a soft pliable coating. In general, any coating material can be used with this invention, provided the coating allows fuel access to the fuel additive composition and does not harm downstream fuel systems, fuel injectors, valves and related engine components.  \\n     35. Typical and preferred coating materials are commercial available polymers co-polymers and block copolymers including, but not limited to: polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Preferably the coating is selected to provide an effective rate of release of the additive into the fuel. By effective rate of release, it will be understood that the additive is released at a concentration sufficient to provide beneficial properties to the fuel and related fuel-handling components.  \\n     36. In other embodiments, the fuel additive can be embedded within a solid matrix. The matrix can be either hydrocarbon soluble or hydrocarbon insoluble. If the matrix material is hydrocarbon insoluble, the fuel must be able to penetrate the matrix and contact the fuel additive. It is particularly advantageous to embed a liquid fuel additive in a solid matrix. This provides one means of controlling the rate the additive is released into fuel.  \\n     37. One alternative design of FIG. 1 includes replacing the plurality of coated tablets  42  with a fewer number of much larger pellets or tablets. By reducing the total surface area of the fuel additive for a specific mass of fuel additive composition, the additive composition dissolves at a slower rate.  \\n     38. Referring now to FIG. 3, an alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As has been previously mentioned, the basic filter components of filter  110  are the same as those of filter  10 , and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a one hundred prefix designation. Located within filter I  10  is cap  136  and base plate  34 . Cap  136  includes opening  144  formed therethrough. Opening  144  can be provided in the form of a diffusion orifice that is defined by a diffusion tube  148 . Thermostat  164  is provided in opening  144 . Thermostat  164  is adapted to control the flow of fuel into inner chamber  40  and can be selected from a wide variety of commercially available thermostats. For example, a wax type thermostat can be adapted for use in the present invention. In preferred operation, the thermostat opens in response to a temperature level of fuel in filter  110 . When opened, the thermostat allows passage of fuel into inner chamber  40 . The thermostat  164  can be adapted to open in response to either fuel that is sufficiently warm or fuel that is sufficiently cool.  \\n     39. In one preferred embodiment, thermostat  164  opens in response to fuel that is sufficiently warm. Fuel additives providing additional benefits to warm fuel can be released on an as-needed release basis. For example, antioxidants and dispersants can be added to the warm fuel to inhibit the deposition of resinous material on filter element  16 . Dispersions can be provided to suspend or dissolve the resinous material, which are eventually burned in an engine (not shown). In alternative embodiments, the thermostat  164  opens when fuel in filter  110  is sufficiently cool. Cool fuel can be indicative of a recently filled tank or of fuel that has not been recirculated through the fuel filter. In either case, the cool fuel may require additional additives to enhance engine performance and/or fuel efficiency. Under certain conditions fuel is circulated through the fuel injection where it becomes heated. The heated fuel can be recirculated through the fuel filter. Since the fuel has already been through the fuel filter, no additional additive may be needed. Thus, when the fuel is sufficiently warm, thermostat  164  can close and prevent the addition of the fuel additive to the heated fuel.  \\n     40. As an additional benefit, tablets  42  can include an anti-gelling agent for diesel fuel. Thermostat  164  can operate to open in response to cool or cold fuel. The anti-gelling additives can be released on a need-release basis into the fuel to enhance engine performance in cold weather.  \\n     41. Fuel filter  110  can also include, but is not required to include, one or more baffle plates  150 . Similar to the design of fuel filter  10 , baffle plates  150  are positioned in inner chamber  40  adjacent to opening  144  in upper wall  162 .  \\n     42. Referring now to FIG. 4, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The basic filter components of filter  210  are the same as those of filter  10 , and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a two hundred prefix designation. Located within filter  210  is a cap  236  and base plate  34 . Cap  236  includes a double wall structure  267  that includes a semi-permeable membrane wafer sandwiched therebetween.  \\n     43. Cap  236  includes inner surface  252 . Inner surface  252  includes a unitary upper wall  262 , which defines centrally therein an orifice  263 . The inner surface  252  includes molded thereon a small annular lip  264  which serves as a retainer for circular plate  265 . Plate  265  functions as a second wall in cooperation with upper wall  262  to hold in position therebetween a substantially cylindrical diffusion or osmotic wafer  248 . The preferred material for diffusion wafer  248  is a microporous polymer, co-polymer or block copolymer including, but not limited to: polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Plate  265  defines centrally therein an opening  266 , which is aligned with opening orifice  263 . This combination permits the gradual migration of fuel into inner chamber  240  to contact tablets  42 . Osmotic wafer  248  is positioned between the fuel additive and the outlet aperture  30  through which the filtered fuel containing the fuel additive flows on toward the engine (not shown). Use of the semi-permeable membrane in the form of membrane  248  permits only a gradual migration of a portion of fuel in filter chamber  14  into inner chamber  240 . This provides a slow release of the fuel additive composition into the fuel to maintain a substantially constant level of fuel additive in the fuel system.  \\n     44. In FIG. 5 there is illustrated yet another embodiment of the present invention. The basic filter components of filter  310  are the same as those of filter  10 , and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a three hundred prefix designation. Filter  310  includes base plate  334  having a lower wall portion  338 . Lower wall portion  338  includes orifice  344  formed therethrough which provides fluid communication between inner chamber  340  and filter chamber  314 . Lower wall  338  also can include an axially protruding tapered diffusion tube  348 . Diffusion tube  348  defines a tapered diffusion passageway for orifice  344  that extends therethrough and establishes a passageway of fluid communication between the inner chamber  340  and filter chamber  314 .  \\n     45. Preferably upper wall  362  of cap  336  includes at least one air vent opening  346 . In one alternative form, outlet endplate  332  can include a substantially circular, hollow vent tube  372  extending obliquely therefrom and adapted to extend from outlet endplate  332  through air vent opening  346  to provide fluid communication between region  370  that is proximate to inlet  328  and inner chamber  340 . In an alternative form, the outlet end plates does not include vent tube  372 , and air vent opening  346  can vent into the interior region  337  of filter chamber  14 . In operation after all the air in inner chamber  340  has escaped through air vent opening  346 , a portion of the fuel mixture in inner chamber  340  could flow out air vent opening  346  into interior region  337  and out outlet  30 , preferably at a substantially lower flow rate than fuel flows from annular space  35  through filter element  16  and out outlet  30 .  \\n     46. In FIG. 6 there is illustrated an alternative embodiment of a fuel filter  410  for use with the present invention. Fuel filter  410  includes a fuel additive in a single large tablet or cartridge  442 . While it is possible to include fuel additive cartridge  442  in either of FIG. 1 or FIGS. 3-5, the use of smaller coated tablets is preferred. By the use of smaller tablets, a larger mass of the fuel additive can be loaded into the inner chamber without any particular regard to the size or shape of the chamber.  \\n     47. While the foregoing description provided several embodiments for controlling the release of a fuel additive composition into fuel, it will be understood that the inner housing assembly can be formed to include a variety of structures and openings to allow migration of fuel into the inner chamber. In preferred embodiments, the inner chamber provides a quiescent region inside filter chamber where a source of a fuel additive surrounded by a portion of the fuel flowing through the fuel filter is protected from the typical fluid forces acting on the fuel in the filter.  \\n     48. The present invention provides a method of enhancing the operation of an internal combustion engine. In one form, the enhancement is provided by controlling the release of a fuel additive into fuel. The controlled released of the additive maintains a constant, uniform concentration of additive in the fuel. In preferred embodiments, the additive is released in a controlled manner to maintain a substantially uniform concentration of additive in the fuel despite the varying amount of fuel that is recirculated through the fuel filter. Use of the present invention decreases the maintenance time and costs, enhances engine performance and increases fuel efficiency. In another form, the invention enhances the usable and/or effective lifespan of fuel filters by providing fuel additives that effectively inhibit the formation of resinous material such as vanishes and asphaltenes and help breakup or disperse such material that has been deposited on fuel handling components.  \\n     49. According to the present invention, a diffusion tube, diffusion orifice, and baffles may be used to slow the release of the fuel additive into the fuel. The coating on the fuel additive also limits the rate of additive that is dissolved in the fuel. These mechanical and chemical arrangements may be used with a plurality of smaller fuel additive pellets, with a larger tablet, or with a singular, large cartridge of fuel additive. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a semipermeable membrane wafer is sandwiched between an upper wall and a retaining plate to provide a slow release means for the mechanism due to the composition of the wafer. This mechanical arrangement may be used with a plurality of smaller tablets or larger tablets or some other form of fuel additives. Further, a thermostat can be included with the openings for each embodiment to provide a need-release feature for the present invention. The thermostat opens in response to fuel that exhibits a temperature level within a predetermined temperature range and permits migration of fuel into the inner chamber.  \\n     50. While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is considered to be illustrative and not restrictive in character, it is understood that only the preferred embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The present invention relates generally to a fuel filter for use with internal combustion engines, for example, but not limited to diesel engines in commercial vehicles. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a fuel filter containing a fuel additive that can be released into fuel and a method of releasing the additive into the fuel. </p>\\n      <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-00002\" num=\"2\">2. Fuel filters are necessary components used to protect combustion engines by filtering out contaminants and thereby preventing damage to the engine and other downstream components such as valves, fuel injectors, fuel lines and related components. Fuel can entrain a wide variety of contaminants from a number of sources. Frequently fuel oxidizes and forms resinous materials such as asphaltenes commonly referred to as varnishes. Bacteria can grow in fuel, particularly fuel that contains moisture. The growing bacteria forms a \u201cslime\u201d on inner surfaces of fuel tanks, fuel lines and fuel filters. The slime often sloughs off the surfaces and fuel transports the free slime through the fuel lines. The fuel filter filters out the varnishes and bacteria; however, in the process the varnish and bacteria block the fuel filter element. The blocked filter exhibits a reduced fuel flow and increases the pressure differential across the filter element, thereby reducing engine performance and fuel efficiency. To maintain engine performance and reliability, the fuel filters must be replaced, often as frequently as every 2,000 to 4,000 vehicle miles. For many vehicles, particularly commercial trucks that travel hundreds or even thousands of miles a month, this significantly increases vehicle maintenance and operating costs and can reduce reliability. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00003\" num=\"3\">3. Fortunately, the formation of varnishes and bacteria growth can be inhibited by adding fuel additives such as antioxidants and biocides to the fuel. Dispersants can be added to break up and dissolve some of the existing material clogging the filters and other fuel related components. To be effective, the additives must be constantly maintained in the fuel. This is often difficult. Unlike other fluid systems, such as the coolant and oil systems, the fuel system does not re-circulate all of the fluid. Therefore, the additives must be continuously added to the fuel at a controlled rate. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00004\" num=\"4\">4. It is difficult to maintain a constant or desired level of an additive in the fuel. Typically an operator adds a bottled additive to the vehicle fuel tank with each fuel fill-up. While many bottled fuel additives are commercially available, often operators do not consistently add the additive with each fill-up. The additive might not be readily available or the operator may forget to include the additive. When the additive is added to the fuel tank, it does not always form a homogeneous mixture with the fuel. Fuel tanks do not include reliable methods for mixing fuel. Generally operators rely upon the turbulence created during a fill-up and by vehicle motion to mix the additive and fuel. Furthermore, the additive concentration in the fuel may vary, depending upon the amount of fuel added-assuming a set amount of additive is added with each fill-up. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00005\" num=\"5\">5. The following references provide a background for filters in general that contain additives. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00006\" num=\"6\">6. Davis in U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,942 describes a pressurized fuel filter having an additive embedded in wax; the wax/additive composition dissolves when contacted with fuel. Additional additive is only added when a portion of the fuel becomes clogged and the fuel level in the filter rises to contact and dissolve additional amounts of the wax/additive composition. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00007\" num=\"7\">7. Lefebvre in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,330 discloses an oil filter that includes a thermoplastic material having oil oxidation and acidification additives. The hot oil recirculating through the engine and the filter dissolves that thermoplastic material thereby releasing the additives into the oil. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-00008\" num=\"8\">8. Hudgens in U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,799 discloses a coolant filter for recirculating coolant.

One of the design challenges addressed by the present invention is how to control the release of fuel additive into the fuel. The present invention solves this challenge in several ways, each of which is believed to be a novel and unobvious solution. The solution avoids the undesirable side effects, which have already been described and can be exploited to increase the maintenance interval, increase the fuel filter life span and enhance engine performance and fuel efficiency. </p>\\n      <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-00010\" num=\"10\">10.

For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will, nevertheless, be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described processes, systems, or devices and any further applications of the principles of the invention as described herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00022\" num=\"22\">22. Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a fuel filter <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The illustrated embodiment of filter <b>10</b> is intended to include basic components in a construction that is typical of such fuel filters with the exception of the fuel additive and the slow-release means associated with the fuel additive. The basic components of filter <b>10</b> include housing <b>12</b> defining a filter chamber <b>14</b>, filter element <b>16</b> disposed within the filter chamber <b>14</b>, drain opening <b>18</b> having an externally threaded wall <b>19</b>, and cap <b>20</b> having internal threads adapted to matingly engage externally threaded wall <b>19</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00023\" num=\"23\">23. Housing <b>12</b> includes a closed base end <b>22</b> and an open outlet end <b>24</b>, which is crimped to the outer edge periphery of nut plate <b>26</b>. The crimped combination creates a filter house assembly <b>23</b>. Nut plate <b>26</b> provides the inlet openings <b>28</b> for fuel to enter filter <b>10</b>. Internally threaded outlet aperture <b>30</b>, which is defined by nut plate <b>26</b>, provides the flow exit for the filtered fuel. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00024\" num=\"24\">24. Filter element <b>16</b> is supported on one end by outlet end plate <b>32</b> and on an opposite end by base plate <b>34</b>. Filter element <b>16</b> is bonded to end plate <b>32</b> to form a fluid tight seal. Fuel enters filter chamber <b>14</b> through inlet <b>28</b> and flows to annular space <b>35</b>. From annular space <b>35</b>, fuel flows radially inward through filter element <b>16</b> into an interior region <b>37</b>, then out through opening <b>39</b> of outlet <b>30</b>. From outlet <b>30</b>, fuel flows to a combustion engine, which can include an carburetor system or fuel injection system (not shown). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00025\" num=\"25\">25. Base end plate <b>34</b> provides a support and a seat for filter element <b>16</b>, as well as for the components associated with the present invention, including the filter additive which is provided in the form of a plurality of tablets or pellets <b>42</b>. In the embodiment illustrated by filter <b>10</b> base plate <b>34</b> is spaced from housing <b>12</b> by spring <b>41</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00026\" num=\"26\">26. The foregoing description of the basic filter components and construction of fuel filter <b>10</b> is provided with regard to FIG. 1 and is applicable to the filter elements depicted in FIGS. 3-6. Accordingly the same reference numerals will be used for the same components. The differences between filters illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3-<b>6</b> are embodied in the structures that house a plurality of coated pellet tablets <b>42</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00027\" num=\"27\">27. Referring to FIG. 1, fuel filter <b>10</b> includes cap <b>36</b> and base plate <b>34</b>, which matingly join together to form inner chamber <b>40</b>. Cap <b>36</b> is substantially cylindrical and includes an upper portion <b>43</b> sized to have an outside diameter smaller than the inside diameter of filter chamber <b>14</b>. Cap <b>36</b> includes an annular shelf <b>45</b> and an upper wall portion <b>62</b>. Annular shelf <b>45</b> provides support for filter element <b>16</b> and is adapted to form a fluid tight seal with the lower portion of filter element <b>16</b>. Upper wall portion <b>62</b> includes orifice <b>44</b>, which provides fluid communication between inner chamber <b>40</b> and inner region <b>37</b>. The upper wall portion can also include at least one, preferably two, vent openings <b>46</b>. Upper wall <b>62</b> includes an axially protruding tapered diffusion tube <b>48</b>. Diffusion tube <b>48</b> defines a tapered diffusion passageway for orifice <b>44</b>, which extends therethrough and establishes a passageway of fluid communication between the inner chamber <b>40</b> and inner region <b>37</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00028\" num=\"28\">28. Referring additionally to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a typical baffle plate <b>50</b> for use with the present invention. Cap <b>36</b> can include, but is not required to include, at least one, preferably a plurality, of baffle plates <b>50</b>. Each baffle plate <b>50</b> includes a plurality of openings <b>51</b> formed therethrough. Baffle plate <b>50</b> is spaced from diffusion tube <b>48</b>. In preferred embodiments, cap <b>36</b> includes three baffle plates <b>50</b> spaced from each other; each baffle plate individually bonded about its peripheral edge to inner surface <b>52</b> of cap <b>36</b>. It will be appreciated that in alternative forms cap <b>36</b>, which includes at least one baffle plate <b>50</b>, need not include a diffusion control orifice or the diffusion tube <b>48</b>. When thus provided, cap <b>36</b> has an opening providing fluid communication with filter chamber <b>12</b> and includes a sufficient number of baffle plates <b>50</b> to slow the flow of fuel into inner chamber <b>40</b> and/or to control the rate of release of the fuel additive. Further, a plurality of baffle plates <b>50</b> can be provided to reduce turbulence in inner chamber <b>44</b>. Preferably, each baffle plate <b>50</b> is spaced from an adjacent baffle plate to misalign the plurality of openings <b>51</b> in the adjacent baffle plates. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00029\" num=\"29\">29. As is illustrated in FIG. 1, cap <b>36</b> seats on base plate <b>34</b> and forms an inner housing <b>43</b> assembly that defines inner chamber <b>40</b>. The only openings into inner chamber <b>40</b> are the diffusion orifice <b>44</b> and vent openings <b>46</b>. Inner chamber <b>40</b> is substantially filled with a fuel additive composition, which is illustrated in a form of a tablet <b>42</b>. It is understood that the fuel additive composition can be provided in a variety of shapes and sizes, including cubic, cylindrical, and spherical. Typically, tablets <b>42</b> are provided in a cubic shape to fill the inner chamber <b>40</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00030\" num=\"30\">30. Fuel from filter chamber <b>12</b> in filter <b>10</b> migrates through the diffusion orifice <b>44</b> into an inner chamber <b>40</b>. Fuel in inner chamber <b>40</b> contacts the outer coating <b>47</b> of fuel additive tablet <b>42</b>. Fuel then diffuses through the coating <b>47</b> to contact the fuel additive composition, which dissolves in the fuel to provide a fuel composition comprising the dissolved additive. The fuel composition diffuses back through coating <b>47</b> into inner chamber <b>40</b>. The fuel composition mixes with fuel in inner chamber <b>40</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00031\" num=\"31\">31. The fuel system is unlike the coolant and oil systems used with internal combustion engines because in some duty cycles the fuel system does not recirculate a significant portion of fluid. Therefore, under these conditions, the majority of fuel entering into filter chamber <b>14</b> has not been recirculated through filter <b>10</b> and for all practical purposes does not include any dissolved additive. While not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the concentration of dissolved additive in the fuel composition in inner chamber <b>40</b> is vastly greater than the concentration of dissolved additive in the fuel in filter chamber <b>14</b> outside inner chamber <b>40</b>. This concentration difference is significantly greater than would be expected in a recirculating fluid system. This concentration difference creates a stronger driving force for the fuel composition to migrate from inner chamber <b>40</b> into filter chamber <b>40</b>. In preferred embodiments, baffle plate <b>50</b> and/or diffusion orifice <b>44</b> are provided to inhibit or reduce the flow of fuel into and out from inner chamber <b>40</b>. This increases the useful lifespan of fuel filter <b>10</b> and controls the rate of release of the fuel additive composition into the fuel. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00032\" num=\"32\">32. Inner chamber <b>40</b> provides a substantially quiescent region inside filter chamber <b>12</b> that does not experience the currents created by fuel flowing through filter <b>10</b>. As the concentration of dissolved fuel additive in inner chamber <b>40</b> increases relative to concentration of the fuel additive in filter chamber <b>12</b>, the fuel composition migrates or diffuses from inner chamber <b>40</b> into filter chamber <b>12</b> in an effort to achieve equilibrium. The fuel composition comprising the dissolved additive and the fuel diffuses through diffusion tube <b>48</b> and diffusion orifice <b>44</b> that defines a restricted opening for the migration of the higher concentration solution out of the inner chamber <b>40</b> and mixes with fuel in filter chamber <b>14</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00033\" num=\"33\">33. The fuel additives for use in this invention can be of liquid or solid form. Two or more fuel additives can be combined to form a fuel additive composition. The fuel additive(s) can be compounded with a suitable polymer either for providing a solid or semisolid material such as tablet <b>42</b> or form for providing a matrix to control the rate of release of the additive into the fuel. The fuel additive can further include a wide variety of binders, compounding agents and mold release agents. When the additive is provided in liquid form, it is preferable, but not required, to combine the liquid fuel additive with a suitable agent to form a solid or semisolid material. As used herein, the term fuel additive includes any commercially known and/or commonly used fuel additive that imparts beneficial properties to the fuel and/or the engine and related fuel-handling components. Common classes of fuel additives include: antioxidants, antiwear agents, cetane improvers, corrosion inhibitors, demulsifiers, detergents, dispersants, flow improvers, lubricity agents, and metal deactivators. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00034\" num=\"34\">34. Tablets <b>42</b> of fuel additive include an outer hydrocarbon insoluble coating <b>47</b>, which encases the fuel additive composition tablet <b>42</b>. The hydrocarbon insoluble coating is selected to be substantially insoluble in hydrocarbon fuel mixtures, yet be permeable to the fuel to allow the fuel to penetrate the coating and contact the fuel additive. A portion of the fuel additive dissolves in the fuel to provide a fuel composition that includes the dissolved fuel additive. The coating may be a hard coating or a soft pliable coating. In general, any coating material can be used with this invention, provided the coating allows fuel access to the fuel additive composition and does not harm downstream fuel systems, fuel injectors, valves and related engine components. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00035\" num=\"35\">35. Typical and preferred coating materials are commercial available polymers co-polymers and block copolymers including, but not limited to: polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Preferably the coating is selected to provide an effective rate of release of the additive into the fuel. By effective rate of release, it will be understood that the additive is released at a concentration sufficient to provide beneficial properties to the fuel and related fuel-handling components. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00036\" num=\"36\">36. In other embodiments, the fuel additive can be embedded within a solid matrix. The matrix can be either hydrocarbon soluble or hydrocarbon insoluble. If the matrix material is hydrocarbon insoluble, the fuel must be able to penetrate the matrix and contact the fuel additive. It is particularly advantageous to embed a liquid fuel additive in a solid matrix. This provides one means of controlling the rate the additive is released into fuel. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00037\" num=\"37\">37. One alternative design of FIG. 1 includes replacing the plurality of coated tablets <b>42</b> with a fewer number of much larger pellets or tablets. By reducing the total surface area of the fuel additive for a specific mass of fuel additive composition, the additive composition dissolves at a slower rate. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00038\" num=\"38\">38. Referring now to FIG. 3, an alternative embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As has been previously mentioned, the basic filter components of filter <b>110</b> are the same as those of filter <b>10</b>, and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a one hundred prefix designation. Located within filter I <b>10</b> is cap <b>136</b> and base plate <b>34</b>. Cap <b>136</b> includes opening <b>144</b> formed therethrough. Opening <b>144</b> can be provided in the form of a diffusion orifice that is defined by a diffusion tube <b>148</b>. Thermostat <b>164</b> is provided in opening <b>144</b>. Thermostat <b>164</b> is adapted to control the flow of fuel into inner chamber <b>40</b> and can be selected from a wide variety of commercially available thermostats. For example, a wax type thermostat can be adapted for use in the present invention. In preferred operation, the thermostat opens in response to a temperature level of fuel in filter <b>110</b>. When opened, the thermostat allows passage of fuel into inner chamber <b>40</b>. The thermostat <b>164</b> can be adapted to open in response to either fuel that is sufficiently warm or fuel that is sufficiently cool. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00039\" num=\"39\">39. In one preferred embodiment, thermostat <b>164</b> opens in response to fuel that is sufficiently warm. Fuel additives providing additional benefits to warm fuel can be released on an as-needed release basis. For example, antioxidants and dispersants can be added to the warm fuel to inhibit the deposition of resinous material on filter element <b>16</b>. Dispersions can be provided to suspend or dissolve the resinous material, which are eventually burned in an engine (not shown). In alternative embodiments, the thermostat <b>164</b> opens when fuel in filter <b>110</b> is sufficiently cool. Cool fuel can be indicative of a recently filled tank or of fuel that has not been recirculated through the fuel filter. In either case, the cool fuel may require additional additives to enhance engine performance and/or fuel efficiency. Under certain conditions fuel is circulated through the fuel injection where it becomes heated. The heated fuel can be recirculated through the fuel filter. Since the fuel has already been through the fuel filter, no additional additive may be needed. Thus, when the fuel is sufficiently warm, thermostat <b>164</b> can close and prevent the addition of the fuel additive to the heated fuel. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00040\" num=\"40\">40. As an additional benefit, tablets <b>42</b> can include an anti-gelling agent for diesel fuel. Thermostat <b>164</b> can operate to open in response to cool or cold fuel. The anti-gelling additives can be released on a need-release basis into the fuel to enhance engine performance in cold weather. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00041\" num=\"41\">41. Fuel filter <b>110</b> can also include, but is not required to include, one or more baffle plates <b>150</b>. Similar to the design of fuel filter <b>10</b>, baffle plates <b>150</b> are positioned in inner chamber <b>40</b> adjacent to opening <b>144</b> in upper wall <b>162</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00042\" num=\"42\">42. Referring now to FIG. 4, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The basic filter components of filter <b>210</b> are the same as those of filter <b>10</b>, and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a two hundred prefix designation. Located within filter <b>210</b> is a cap <b>236</b> and base plate <b>34</b>. Cap <b>236</b> includes a double wall structure <b>267</b> that includes a semi-permeable membrane wafer sandwiched therebetween. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00043\" num=\"43\">43. Cap <b>236</b> includes inner surface <b>252</b>. Inner surface <b>252</b> includes a unitary upper wall <b>262</b>, which defines centrally therein an orifice <b>263</b>. The inner surface <b>252</b> includes molded thereon a small annular lip <b>264</b> which serves as a retainer for circular plate <b>265</b>. Plate <b>265</b> functions as a second wall in cooperation with upper wall <b>262</b> to hold in position therebetween a substantially cylindrical diffusion or osmotic wafer <b>248</b>. The preferred material for diffusion wafer <b>248</b> is a microporous polymer, co-polymer or block copolymer including, but not limited to: polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Plate <b>265</b> defines centrally therein an opening <b>266</b>, which is aligned with opening orifice <b>263</b>. This combination permits the gradual migration of fuel into inner chamber <b>240</b> to contact tablets <b>42</b>. Osmotic wafer <b>248</b> is positioned between the fuel additive and the outlet aperture <b>30</b> through which the filtered fuel containing the fuel additive flows on toward the engine (not shown). Use of the semi-permeable membrane in the form of membrane <b>248</b> permits only a gradual migration of a portion of fuel in filter chamber <b>14</b> into inner chamber <b>240</b>. This provides a slow release of the fuel additive composition into the fuel to maintain a substantially constant level of fuel additive in the fuel system. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00044\" num=\"44\">44. In FIG. 5 there is illustrated yet another embodiment of the present invention. The basic filter components of filter <b>310</b> are the same as those of filter <b>10</b>, and accordingly, the same reference numbers have been used for the basic components. Alternative and additional components are referenced with a three hundred prefix designation. Filter <b>310</b> includes base plate <b>334</b> having a lower wall portion <b>338</b>. Lower wall portion <b>338</b> includes orifice <b>344</b> formed therethrough which provides fluid communication between inner chamber <b>340</b> and filter chamber <b>314</b>. Lower wall <b>338</b> also can include an axially protruding tapered diffusion tube <b>348</b>. Diffusion tube <b>348</b> defines a tapered diffusion passageway for orifice <b>344</b> that extends therethrough and establishes a passageway of fluid communication between the inner chamber <b>340</b> and filter chamber <b>314</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00045\" num=\"45\">45. Preferably upper wall <b>362</b> of cap <b>336</b> includes at least one air vent opening <b>346</b>. In one alternative form, outlet endplate <b>332</b> can include a substantially circular, hollow vent tube <b>372</b> extending obliquely therefrom and adapted to extend from outlet endplate <b>332</b> through air vent opening <b>346</b> to provide fluid communication between region <b>370</b> that is proximate to inlet <b>328</b> and inner chamber <b>340</b>. In an alternative form, the outlet end plates does not include vent tube <b>372</b>, and air vent opening <b>346</b> can vent into the interior region <b>337</b> of filter chamber <b>14</b>. In operation after all the air in inner chamber <b>340</b> has escaped through air vent opening <b>346</b>, a portion of the fuel mixture in inner chamber <b>340</b> could flow out air vent opening <b>346</b> into interior region <b>337</b> and out outlet <b>30</b>, preferably at a substantially lower flow rate than fuel flows from annular space <b>35</b> through filter element <b>16</b> and out outlet <b>30</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00046\" num=\"46\">46. In FIG. 6 there is illustrated an alternative embodiment of a fuel filter <b>410</b> for use with the present invention. Fuel filter <b>410</b> includes a fuel additive in a single large tablet or cartridge <b>442</b>. While it is possible to include fuel additive cartridge <b>442</b> in either of FIG. 1 or FIGS. 3-5, the use of smaller coated tablets is preferred. By the use of smaller tablets, a larger mass of the fuel additive can be loaded into the inner chamber without any particular regard to the size or shape of the chamber. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00047\" num=\"47\">47. While the foregoing description provided several embodiments for controlling the release of a fuel additive composition into fuel, it will be understood that the inner housing assembly can be formed to include a variety of structures and openings to allow migration of fuel into the inner chamber. In preferred embodiments, the inner chamber provides a quiescent region inside filter chamber where a source of a fuel additive surrounded by a portion of the fuel flowing through the fuel filter is protected from the typical fluid forces acting on the fuel in the filter. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00048\" num=\"48\">48. The present invention provides a method of enhancing the operation of an internal combustion engine. In one form, the enhancement is provided by controlling the release of a fuel additive into fuel. The controlled released of the additive maintains a constant, uniform concentration of additive in the fuel. In preferred embodiments, the additive is released in a controlled manner to maintain a substantially uniform concentration of additive in the fuel despite the varying amount of fuel that is recirculated through the fuel filter. Use of the present invention decreases the maintenance time and costs, enhances engine performance and increases fuel efficiency. In another form, the invention enhances the usable and/or effective lifespan of fuel filters by providing fuel additives that effectively inhibit the formation of resinous material such as vanishes and asphaltenes and help breakup or disperse such material that has been deposited on fuel handling components. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00049\" num=\"49\">49. According to the present invention, a diffusion tube, diffusion orifice, and baffles may be used to slow the release of the fuel additive into the fuel. The coating on the fuel additive also limits the rate of additive that is dissolved in the fuel. These mechanical and chemical arrangements may be used with a plurality of smaller fuel additive pellets, with a larger tablet, or with a singular, large cartridge of fuel additive. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a semipermeable membrane wafer is sandwiched between an upper wall and a retaining plate to provide a slow release means for the mechanism due to the composition of the wafer. This mechanical arrangement may be used with a plurality of smaller tablets or larger tablets or some other form of fuel additives. Further, a thermostat can be included with the openings for each embodiment to provide a need-release feature for the present invention. The thermostat opens in response to fuel that exhibits a temperature level within a predetermined temperature range and permits migration of fuel into the inner chamber. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-00050\" num=\"50\">50. While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is considered to be illustrative and not restrictive in character, it is understood that only the preferred embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0001] 1. Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a strong phase shifting mask (PSM), and more particularly to a method of manufacturing a strong PSM with dual trenches.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Related Art  \\n       [0004] Currently, photolithography plays an essential role in semiconductor fabrication. For example, processes for patterning a structure or doping a region in a wafer always require several photolithography processes. In a photolithography process, exposure resolution and depth of focus (DOF) are two important parameters that determine photolithography quality. As the integration of semiconductor devices increases, a high pattern exposure resolution becomes critical. One proposed solution to obtaining a high pattern exposure resolution would use a light source with a shorter wavelength, such as a deep ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 2480 angstroms produced by a Kr laser. However, even through a light source with shorter wavelength can increase the pattern exposure resolution, the DOF deteriorates. Another recently proposed solution would use a phase shifting mask in photolithography technology so as to obtain a high pattern resolution.  \\n       [0005] The theory of a PSM is to use a phase shifting layer formed on a conventional photo-mask. The phase shifting layer has a light inversion property that inverts the phase of light passing through the phase shifting layer. When the PSM is exposed to a light source, the light passing through the phase shifting layer has an inverted wave phase and can interfere with a normal light, that has not passed through the phase shifting layer. Since the amplitude of the inverted wave phase is negative, an amplitude subtraction occurs around the interface between the normal light and the inverted wave light, resulting in a zero amplitude. When a wafer is exposed by light that has passed through the PSM, a light intensity distribution, which is the square of the amplitude distribution, with better resolution appears on the wafer. The light intensity distribution actually forms a desired pattern with a better pattern resolution. Using the PSM to obtain a better pattern resolution does not require a new light source with a short wavelength. This is the advantage of the PSM.  \\n       [0006] Types of PSM include a strong PSM and a weak PSM. The strong PSM further includes a Levenson and an alternating PSM. The weak PSM comprises a half-tone PSM, a rim PSM and an attenuated PSM.  \\n       [0007]FIG. 1 is a flow chart of steps in the manufacturing process for a strong PSM as known in prior art and FIGS.  2 A- 2 F illustrate the manufacture of a strong PSM corresponding to FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2A, a chromium film  202  is formed on a quartz substrate  200 , and then a photoresist layer  204  is coated on the chromium film  202  (step  100 ). After the photoresist layer  204  is exposed and developed (step  102 ), the pattern of the photoresist later  204   a  is formed and is illustrated as photoresist layer  204   a  in FIG. 2B. The exposed chromium film  202   a  is etched to form openings  206 ,  208  as shown in FIG. 2C (step  106 ). The photoresist layer  204   a  is then removed, and accordingly the quartz substrate  200  that is covered with the chromium film  202   a  is opaque.  \\n       [0008] Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2D, a photoresist layer  210  is coated again on the quartz substrate  200  (step  108 ). The opening  208  (FIG. 2C) is covered with the photoresist layer  210  after exposure and development (step  110 ), so that the opening  206  is exposed. An etching process is then performed on the quartz substrate  200 , and the opening  206  exposed by the photoresist layer  210  and the chromium film  202   a  is etched to a depth \u2018d\u2019 to obtain an opening  206   a , as shown in FIG. 2E. Then, the photoresist layer  208  is stripped away, as shown in FIG. 2F (step  114 ).  \\n       [0009] In order to enhance diffraction of a conventional photo-mask, a phase shift of 180\u00b0 between the opening  206   a  and the opening  208  is required. However, in the fabrication of the strong PSM, particles are produced and fall into the opening  206   a  while etching the quartz substrate  200 . Therefore, protuberances are formed on the exposed quartz substrate  200  in the opening  206   a  and cause a phase defect when light passes through the opening  206   a . To prevent the phase defect, the phase shift to 180\u00b0 is accomplished by etching the quartz substrate  200  three times. The first etching step (step  112 ) etches the quartz substrate  200  of the opening  206  to a depth \u2018d\u2019 with a phase shift of 60\u00b0, as shown in FIG. 2F. Thereafter, the steps from FIG. 2D to FIG. 2F (step  108  to step  114 ) twice repeat etching to a depth \u2018d\u2032\u2019, as shown in FIG. 2G, and as a result, a phase shift of 180\u00b0 between the opening  206   b  and opening  208  can be attained when light passes through. Since the phase shift to 180\u00b0 is accomplished by three etching steps, each etching step enables the particles produced by etching the quartz substrate  200  in the opening  206   b  to reduce in size. Therefore, the phase defect is reduced to 60\u00b0. But processes to manufacture the quartz substrate  200  with the opening  206   b  need at least three steps of photolithography, exposure, development and etching, which not only increases the manufacturing cost, but also spends plenty of cycle time, so that the requirement of economic efficiency for semiconductor device cannot be satisfied.  \\n       [0010] In addition, when the opening  206   b  is opened by etching, the exposed quartz substrate  200  within the opening  206   b  is rough, resulting in scattering as the light passes through. This causes an intensity imbalance between the opening  206   b  and the opening  208 , as shown in FIG. 3. When the photo-mask is utilized to perform photolithography on a semiconductor substrate, a photoresist layer used for the photolithography becomes asymmetrical, leading to an error in the size of the semiconductor device.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0011] Therefore, this invention is directed towards a method of manufacturing a strong PSM that reduces the manufacturing cost and cycle time, and also enhances intensity imbalance. A phase shifting layer is formed on a mask substrate, and a first opening and a second opening are formed within the phase shifting layer by patterning to expose a portion of the mask substrate. Thereafter, the mask substrate is etched along the first opening to a first depth wherein the first depth has a phase shift of 90\u00b0 with the second opening. The mask substrate is etched again along the first opening to a second depth wherein the second depth has a phase shift of 180\u00b0 with the second opening. An etching step is then carried out along the first opening and the second opening, simultaneously, to obtain respectively a third depth and a fourth depth of the first opening and the second opening with a phase shift of 180\u00b0.  \\n       [0012] This invention uses a 90\u00b0 phase shift to determine an etching depth of the mask substrate; therefore, photolithography is performed twice and the phase shift of 180\u00b0 is obtained. Accordingly, the complicated processes as seen in conventional technology can be simplified. Additionally, a dual trenche structure is formed in the mask substrate by an additional etching step after the phase shift reaches 180\u00b0. The imbalance intensity is thus improved and the 90\u00b0 phase defect becomes smaller due to the additional etching step.  \\n       [0013] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0014] The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification. The drawings illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. In the drawings,  \\n     [0015]FIG. 1 is flow chart illustrating steps in the manufacturing process of the conventional strong PSM;  \\n     [0016] FIGS.  2 A- 2 G are schematic, cross-sectional views illustrating manufacture of strong PSM known in prior art;  \\n     [0017]FIG. 3 shows the intensity distribution of the conventional strong PSM;  \\n     [0018] FIGS.  4 A- 4 H are schematic, cross-sectional views illustrating manufacture of a strong PSM in a preferred embodiment according to the invention;  \\n     [0019]FIG. 5 shows the intensity distribution of the strong PSM in a preferred embodiment according to the invention;  \\n     [0020]FIG. 6 shows a pattern in which a gate is connected with a wiring line; and  \\n     [0021] FIGS.  7 A- 7 B shows a double exposure photolithography process.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0022] Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.  \\n     [0023] Two photolithography processes and three etching steps are utilized to reach the required 180\u00b0 phase shift. There are fewer photolithography processes in the invention than in the prior art. The two openings become dual trench structures after the last etching step to enable equal light intensity when light passes through the dual trenches, and moreover, the phase defect becomes smaller due to the last etching step.  \\n     [0024] FIGS.  4 A- 4 H are cross-sectional views illustrating manufacture of a strong PSM in a preferred embodiment according to this invention. Referring to FIG. 4A, a phase shifting layer  402  is formed on a mask substrate  400 . The mask substrate  400  can be quartz and the phase shifting layer can be chromium. A photoresist layer  404  to define the phase shifting layer  402  is then coated thereon, and the photoresist layer  404   a , as shown in FIG. 4B, is formed by exposure and development. The phase shifting layer  402  is then patterned by the photoresist layer  404   a . For example, the phase shifting layer  402  exposed by the photoresist layer  404   a  is removed by wet etching, and openings  406 ,  408  are formed within the phase shifting layer  402   a  to expose a portion of the mask substrate  400 . The top view of the pattern of the openings  406 ,  408  depends on the layout design of the semiconductor device.  \\n     [0025] A photoresist layer  410  is formed and then patterned over the phase shifting layer  402   a , as shown in FIG. 4D. The opening  408  is covered with the photoresist layer  410  and the mask substrate  400  of the opening  406  is exposed. With the covering of the photoresist layer  410 , an etching step such as dry etching is anisotropically performed on the exposed mask substrate  400  of the opening  406 . Referring to FIG. 4E, the mask substrate  400  is etched to a depth \u2018s\u2019 to form an opening  406   a  and then the photoresist layer  410  is stripped. The depth \u2018s\u2019 of the opening  406   a  has a 90\u00b0 phase shift with the opening  408  when light passes through.  \\n     [0026] Referring to FIG. 4F, a photoresist layer  412  is coated on the phase shifting layer  402   a . After exposure and development, the photoresist layer  412  covers the opening  408  and the mask substrate  400  of the opening  406   a  is exposed. Then, the exposed mask substrate  400  of the opening  406   a  is etched to a depth \u2018s\u2032\u2019 and when light passes through, a 180\u00b0 phase shift is produced between the opening  406   b  and the opening  408 , as illustrated in FIG. 4G. The photoresist layer  412  in FIG. 4F is removed.  \\n     [0027] Referring to FIG. 4H, an etching step, such as dry etching, is anisotropically performed on the mask substrate  400 . The openings  406   b ,  408  are thus etched to a depth \u2018s\u2033\u2019 and r, respectively, to form a dual trench structure within the mask substrate  400 . When light passes through the openings  406   c ,  408   a , the phase shift is maintained at 180\u00b0. Since the exposed surface of openings  406   c ,  408   a  is obtained by etching steps, they both are rough, and, as a result, scattering from the opening  406   c  is similar to that of the opening  408   a , leading to a balance of the intensity distribution when light penetrates the openings  406   c ,  408   a , as shown in FIG. 5. Because this etching step does not need a photoresist layer on which to form, the particles are not produced from the photoresist layer and left in the openings  406   b ,  408  to cause a serious phase defect. Additionally, a phase shift of 90\u00b0 may be generated due to the 90\u00b0 phase shift etching, but the last etching step is capable etching the particles left in the openings  406   b  and the phase defect can be reduced. Therefore, the reliability of the photolithography performed by the phase shift mask produced in this invention can be improved. With respect to manufacture of the mask substrate  400 , only two photolithography processes and three etching steps are needed to form a dual trench structure. Therefore, the process to fabricate the phase shifting mask in this invention is easier than that of prior art, and the manufacturing cost and cycle time are reduced.  \\n     [0028] Double exposure, which utilizes two different masks to perform an exposure step, is currently important in development of a phase shifting mask. One mask is a conventional mask and is also called a binary mask. The other mask is a phase shifting mask. The phase shifting mask produced in this invention is used in double exposure, to thereby overcome the difficulties that the conventional mask cannot solve.  \\n     [0029]FIG. 6 shows a top view of the layout of semiconductor devices in which the gates  600  are connected with a wiring line  602 . In conventional technology, if a binary mask is used to achieve the pattern shown in FIG. 6, the width of the wiring line  602  is restricted with the light source resolution and a desired size that, as it reduces, cannot be obtained. On the other hand, it is more difficult to manufacture a phase shifting mask whose pattern including the gates  600  and the wiring line  602  as is shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, double exposure is therefore developed.  \\n     [0030] Referring to FIG. 7A, the dot pattern  700  represents the gates  600  connected with the wiring line  602  in FIG. 6. The first exposure step uses the phase shifting mask manufactured according to this invention. The transparent portion  702   a ,  702   b  of the phase shifting mask is disposed beside the wiring line  700   b  and the opaque portion covers another part of the semiconductor substrate (not shown). The transparent portion  702   a ,  702   b  of the phase shifting mask has a phase shift 180\u00b0, and a distance between the transparent portions  702   a ,  702   b  equals the width of the wiring line  602  in FIG. 6. Since the phase shifting mask with this pattern  702   a ,  702   b  is easily fabricated, the manufacturing cost is reduced. Thereafter, the second exposure step utilizes a binary mask. An opaque pattern portion  704  of the binary mask is the same as the gates  600  and the wiring line  602  in FIG. 7B. The only difference is that a width w\u2032 of the opaque portion  704  is larger than the width of the wiring line  602  (FIG. 6). Since the width of the wiring line  602  has been patterned during the first exposure step, the width w\u2032 of pattern  704  is not limited by the width of the wiring line  602 . Therefore, the width w\u2032 of the pattern  704  is larger than the width w, and the method to produce the binary mask used for the second exposure step is simplified. Accordingly, using double exposure to carry out the photolithography not only enables the manufacture of mask to be easier, but also achieves the requirement of the line width.  \\n     [0031] In a word, the process to manufacture the phase shifting mask with dual trenches according to this invention is simplified and the intensity imbalance is improved when light passes through. In addition, the phase defect can be reduced by the last etching step and the dual trench structure is produced by the last etching step. Therefore, the manufacturing cost is reduced, the cycle time is shortened and the resolution of the photolithography process is enhanced. Moreover, the difficulty in the line width and the mask manufacture can be overcome by the phase shifting mask used in the double exposure.  \\n     [0032] Other embodiments of the invention will appear to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Then, the photoresist layer <b>208</b> is stripped away, as shown in FIG. 2F (step <b>114</b>). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] In order to enhance diffraction of a conventional photo-mask, a phase shift of 180\u00b0 between the opening <b>206</b> <i>a </i>and the opening <b>208</b> is required. However, in the fabrication of the strong PSM, particles are produced and fall into the opening <b>206</b> <i>a </i>while etching the quartz substrate <b>200</b>. Therefore, protuberances are formed on the exposed quartz substrate <b>200</b> in the opening <b>206</b> <i>a </i>and cause a phase defect when light passes through the opening <b>206</b> <i>a</i>. To prevent the phase defect, the phase shift to 180\u00b0 is accomplished by etching the quartz substrate <b>200</b> three times. The first etching step (step <b>112</b>) etches the quartz substrate <b>200</b> of the opening <b>206</b> to a depth \u2018d\u2019 with a phase shift of 60\u00b0, as shown in FIG. 2F. Thereafter, the steps from FIG. 2D to FIG. 2F (step <b>108</b> to step <b>114</b>) twice repeat etching to a depth \u2018d\u2032\u2019, as shown in FIG. 2G, and as a result, a phase shift of 180\u00b0 between the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>and opening <b>208</b> can be attained when light passes through. Since the phase shift to 180\u00b0 is accomplished by three etching steps, each etching step enables the particles produced by etching the quartz substrate <b>200</b> in the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>to reduce in size. Therefore, the phase defect is reduced to 60\u00b0. But processes to manufacture the quartz substrate <b>200</b> with the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>need at least three steps of photolithography, exposure, development and etching, which not only increases the manufacturing cost, but also spends plenty of cycle time, so that the requirement of economic efficiency for semiconductor device cannot be satisfied. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010] In addition, when the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>is opened by etching, the exposed quartz substrate <b>200</b> within the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>is rough, resulting in scattering as the light passes through. This causes an intensity imbalance between the opening <b>206</b> <i>b </i>and the opening <b>208</b>, as shown in FIG. 3. When the photo-mask is utilized to perform photolithography on a semiconductor substrate, a photoresist layer used for the photolithography becomes asymmetrical, leading to an error in the size of the semiconductor device. </p>\\n      <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011] Therefore, this invention is directed towards a method of manufacturing a strong PSM that reduces the manufacturing cost and cycle time, and also enhances intensity imbalance. A phase shifting layer is formed on a mask substrate, and a first opening and a second opening are formed within the phase shifting layer by patterning to expose a portion of the mask substrate. Thereafter, the mask substrate is etched along the first opening to a first depth wherein the first depth has a phase shift of 90\u00b0 with the second opening. The mask substrate is etched again along the first opening to a second depth wherein the second depth has a phase shift of 180\u00b0 with the second opening. An etching step is then carried out along the first opening and the second opening, simultaneously, to obtain respectively a third depth and a fourth depth of the first opening and the second opening with a phase shift of 180\u00b0. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012] This invention uses a 90\u00b0 phase shift to determine an etching depth of the mask substrate; therefore, photolithography is performed twice and the phase shift of 180\u00b0 is obtained. Accordingly, the complicated processes as seen in conventional technology can be simplified. Additionally, a dual trenche structure is formed in the mask substrate by an additional etching step after the phase shift reaches 180\u00b0. The imbalance intensity is thus improved and the 90\u00b0 phase defect becomes smaller due to the additional etching step. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. </p>\\n    </summary-of-invention>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>\\n    <p id=\"P-0014\" num=\"0014\">[0014] The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0023\" num=\"0023\">[0023] Two photolithography processes and three etching steps are utilized to reach the required 180\u00b0 phase shift. There are fewer photolithography processes in the invention than in the prior art. The two openings become dual trench structures after the last etching step to enable equal light intensity when light passes through the dual trenches, and moreover, the phase defect becomes smaller due to the last etching step. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0024\" num=\"0024\">[0024] FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>H are cross-sectional views illustrating manufacture of a strong PSM in a preferred embodiment according to this invention. Referring to FIG. 4A, a phase shifting layer <b>402</b> is formed on a mask substrate <b>400</b>. The mask substrate <b>400</b> can be quartz and the phase shifting layer can be chromium. A photoresist layer <b>404</b> to define the phase shifting layer <b>402</b> is then coated thereon, and the photoresist layer <b>404</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in FIG. 4B, is formed by exposure and development. The phase shifting layer <b>402</b> is then patterned by the photoresist layer <b>404</b> <i>a</i>. For example, the phase shifting layer <b>402</b> exposed by the photoresist layer <b>404</b> <i>a </i>is removed by wet etching, and openings <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> are formed within the phase shifting layer <b>402</b> <i>a </i>to expose a portion of the mask substrate <b>400</b>. The top view of the pattern of the openings <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> depends on the layout design of the semiconductor device. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0025\" num=\"0025\">[0025] A photoresist layer <b>410</b> is formed and then patterned over the phase shifting layer <b>402</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in FIG. 4D. The opening <b>408</b> is covered with the photoresist layer <b>410</b> and the mask substrate <b>400</b> of the opening <b>406</b> is exposed. With the covering of the photoresist layer <b>410</b>, an etching step such as dry etching is anisotropically performed on the exposed mask substrate <b>400</b> of the opening <b>406</b>. Referring to FIG. 4E, the mask substrate <b>400</b> is etched to a depth \u2018s\u2019 to form an opening <b>406</b> <i>a </i>and then the photoresist layer <b>410</b> is stripped. The depth \u2018s\u2019 of the opening <b>406</b> <i>a </i>has a 90\u00b0 phase shift with the opening <b>408</b> when light passes through. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0026\" num=\"0026\">[0026] Referring to FIG. 4F, a photoresist layer <b>412</b> is coated on the phase shifting layer <b>402</b> <i>a</i>. After exposure and development, the photoresist layer <b>412</b> covers the opening <b>408</b> and the mask substrate <b>400</b> of the opening <b>406</b> <i>a </i>is exposed. Then, the exposed mask substrate <b>400</b> of the opening <b>406</b> <i>a </i>is etched to a depth \u2018s\u2032\u2019 and when light passes through, a 180\u00b0 phase shift is produced between the opening <b>406</b> <i>b </i>and the opening <b>408</b>, as illustrated in FIG. 4G. The photoresist layer <b>412</b> in FIG. 4F is removed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0027\" num=\"0027\">[0027] Referring to FIG. 4H, an etching step, such as dry etching, is anisotropically performed on the mask substrate <b>400</b>. The openings <b>406</b> <i>b</i>, <b>408</b> are thus etched to a depth \u2018s\u2033\u2019 and r, respectively, to form a dual trench structure within the mask substrate <b>400</b>. When light passes through the openings <b>406</b> <i>c</i>, <b>408</b> <i>a</i>, the phase shift is maintained at 180\u00b0. Since the exposed surface of openings <b>406</b> <i>c</i>, <b>408</b> <i>a </i>is obtained by etching steps, they both are rough, and, as a result, scattering from the opening <b>406</b> <i>c </i>is similar to that of the opening <b>408</b> <i>a</i>, leading to a balance of the intensity distribution when light penetrates the openings <b>406</b> <i>c</i>, <b>408</b> <i>a</i>, as shown in FIG. 5. Because this etching step does not need a photoresist layer on which to form, the particles are not produced from the photoresist layer and left in the openings <b>406</b> <i>b</i>, <b>408</b> to cause a serious phase defect. Additionally, a phase shift of 90\u00b0 may be generated due to the 90\u00b0 phase shift etching, but the last etching step is capable etching the particles left in the openings <b>406</b> <i>b </i>and the phase defect can be reduced. Therefore, the reliability of the photolithography performed by the phase shift mask produced in this invention can be improved. With respect to manufacture of the mask substrate <b>400</b>, only two photolithography processes and three etching steps are needed to form a dual trench structure. Therefore, the process to fabricate the phase shifting mask in this invention is easier than that of prior art, and the manufacturing cost and cycle time are reduced. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0028\" num=\"0028\">[0028] Double exposure, which utilizes two different masks to perform an exposure step, is currently important in development of a phase shifting mask. One mask is a conventional mask and is also called a binary mask. The other mask is a phase shifting mask. The phase shifting mask produced in this invention is used in double exposure, to thereby overcome the difficulties that the conventional mask cannot solve. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0029\" num=\"0029\">[0029]FIG. 6 shows a top view of the layout of semiconductor devices in which the gates <b>600</b> are connected with a wiring line <b>602</b>. In conventional technology, if a binary mask is used to achieve the pattern shown in FIG. 6, the width of the wiring line <b>602</b> is restricted with the light source resolution and a desired size that, as it reduces, cannot be obtained. On the other hand, it is more difficult to manufacture a phase shifting mask whose pattern including the gates <b>600</b> and the wiring line <b>602</b> as is shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, double exposure is therefore developed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0030\" num=\"0030\">[0030] Referring to FIG. 7A, the dot pattern <b>700</b> represents the gates <b>600</b> connected with the wiring line <b>602</b> in FIG. 6. The first exposure step uses the phase shifting mask manufactured according to this invention. The transparent portion <b>702</b> <i>a</i>, <b>702</b> <i>b </i>of the phase shifting mask is disposed beside the wiring line <b>700</b> <i>b </i>and the opaque portion covers another part of the semiconductor substrate (not shown). The transparent portion <b>702</b> <i>a</i>, <b>702</b> <i>b </i>of the phase shifting mask has a phase shift 180\u00b0, and a distance between the transparent portions <b>702</b> <i>a</i>, <b>702</b> <i>b </i>equals the width of the wiring line <b>602</b> in FIG. 6. Since the phase shifting mask with this pattern <b>702</b> <i>a</i>, <b>702</b> <i>b </i>is easily fabricated, the manufacturing cost is reduced. Thereafter, the second exposure step utilizes a binary mask. An opaque pattern portion <b>704</b> of the binary mask is the same as the gates <b>600</b> and the wiring line <b>602</b> in FIG. 7B. The only difference is that a width w\u2032 of the opaque portion <b>704</b> is larger than the width of the wiring line <b>602</b> (FIG. 6). Since the width of the wiring line <b>602</b> has been patterned during the first exposure step, the width w\u2032 of pattern <b>704</b> is not limited by the width of the wiring line <b>602</b>. Therefore, the width w\u2032 of the pattern <b>704</b> is larger than the width w, and the method to produce the binary mask used for the second exposure step is simplified. Accordingly, using double exposure to carry out the photolithography not only enables the manufacture of mask to be easier, but also achieves the requirement of the line width. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0031\" num=\"0031\">[0031] In a word, the process to manufacture the phase shifting mask with dual trenches according to this invention is simplified and the intensity imbalance is improved when light passes through. In addition, the phase defect can be reduced by the last etching step and the dual trench structure is produced by the last etching step. Therefore, the manufacturing cost is reduced, the cycle time is shortened and the resolution of the photolithography process is enhanced. Moreover, the difficulty in the line width and the mask manufacture can be overcome by the phase shifting mask used in the double exposure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0032\" num=\"0032\">[0032] Other embodiments of the invention will appear to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein.

No. 08/262,424, filed Jun. 20, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,111.  \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0002] The present invention relates to novel assay methods for determining the presence or concentration of oxalate in a sample. The present invention further relates to the cloning, sequencing and expression of formyl-CoA transferase, an enzyme used in the novel assay for the detection of oxalate.  \\n       [0003] Oxalic acid (Oxalate) is a highly toxic natural by-product of catabolism in vertebrate animals and many consumable plants. Unfortunately, a significant portion of humans are unable to properly metabolizing oxalate, a condition which may result in the formation of kidney stones in those persons. It is estimated that 70% of all kidney stones are composed of some amount of oxalate. Approximately 12 percent of the U.S. population will suffer from a kidney stone at some time in their lives, and the incidence is rising not only in the United States, but also in Sweden and Japan (Curhan, 1993). Moreover, although a healthy person breaks down or excretes sufficient quantities of oxalate to avoid excessive accumulation of oxalate in the tissues, a number of disease states are known to be associated with malfunctions of oxalate metabolism, including pyridoxine deficiency, renal failure and primary hyperoxaluria, a metabolic genetic disorder that results in the excessive deposition of oxalate in the kidneys.  \\n       [0004] Persons suffering from and at risk for developing kidney stones, as well as patients with lipid malabsorption problems (e.g., sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory intestinal disease, bowel resection, etc.), tend to have elevated levels of urinary oxalate, a fact that has been exploited as a means for identifying individuals at risk. While elevated levels of oxalate may be present in urine, detecting elevated levels of oxalate in serum has not been routine due to the difficulty in detecting the low levels of oxalate present in serum.  \\n       [0005] Most previous methods for measuring oxalate in a biological sample first require the isolation of the oxalate by precipitation, solvent extraction, or an ion-exchange absorption (Hodgkinson, 1970). Quantitation of the isolated oxalate may be determined by any one of several methods including colorimetry, fluorometry, gas-liquid chromatography or isotope dilution techniques. Because many of the oxalate isolation techniques used in these analytical methods are not quantitative, it is normally necessary to correct for the low recovery of oxalate by adding a  14 C-labeled oxalic acid internal standard, which further complicates the analytical method. All these methods are laborious, and consequently expensive because of the amount of skilled laboratory technician time which must be employed. In addition, isolation of the oxalate may require relatively large sample volumes for starting material.  \\n       [0006] Recently, several advances in the detection and quantitation of oxalate have been made through the use of (a) oxalate degrading enzymes and (b) high performance liquid chromatography. One commercially-available enzymatic test (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.) employs oxalate oxidase to oxidize oxalate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced can then be measured colorimetrically in a second enzymatic reaction in the presence of peroxidase.  \\n       [0007] In another enzymatic method for measuring oxalate, oxalate decarboxylase is used to convert oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. The resultant carbon dioxide can be measured manometrically, by the pH change in a carbon dioxide trapping buffer or by the color change in a pH indicator buffer. Whatever method of carbon dioxide assay is adopted, the time required for diffusion and equilibration of carbon dioxide is much longer than is desirable for a rapid analytical method.  \\n       [0008] Alternatively, the formate produced by the action of oxalate decarboxylase can be assayed with formate dehydrogenase in an NAD/NADH coupled reaction, as described in Costello, 1976 and Yriberri, 1980. This method is both cumbersome and time-consuming because oxalate decarboxylase and formate dehydrogenase differ in their optimum pH requirements, thus necessitating a pH adjustment during the analysis.  \\n       [0009] Another commercially available enzymatic test (Boehringer Mannheim) cleaves oxalate to formate and carbon dioxide, then oxidizes the formate to bicarbonate by NAD in the presence of the enzyme formate dehydrogenase. The amount of NADH is determined by means of its absorbance at 334, 340, or 365 nm. Another test (\u201cSTONE RISK\u201d by Mission Pharmacal) measures oxalate as a part of a battery of tests for kidney stones.  \\n       [0010] As illustrated above, the currently existing assays for oxalate suffer from numerous problems, including cost, inaccuracy, reliability, complexity, and lack of sensitivity. Accordingly, it is an object of the subject invention to provide a simple, accurate, and sensitive assay for the detection of low levels of oxalate in a biological sample.  \\n       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0011] The subject invention concerns the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the formyl-CoA transferase and the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase genes of  Oxalobacter formigenes,  and the use of the enzymes to detect the presence of oxalate in a sample. The assay of the subject invention provides, for the first time, a rapid, sensitive method to detect even very low concentrations of oxalate in biological samples. Advantageously, the biological samples in which oxalate can be detected include both urine and serum samples. The enzyme system used according to the subject invention converts oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. In a preferred embodiment of the subject invention, the production of formate is then measured calorimetrically. This assay provides a sensitive, accurate and convenient means for detecting oxalate.  \\n       [0012] A further aspect of the subject invention is the discovery of the  O. formigenes  genes which encode the formyl-CoA transferase and the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase enzymes. The discovery of these genes makes it possible to efficiently produce large quantities of pure formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase for use in the assay of the subject invention or other appropriate application.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE FIGURES  \\n     [0013] FIGS.  1 A-E show the detection of varying concentrations of oxalate in a sample. Colorimetric absorbance for each sample was plotted over time (minutes). Positive and negative control panels are also shown.  \\n     [0014]FIG. 2 shows a partial nucleotide sequence of the formyl-CoA transferase gene.  \\n     [0015]FIGS. 3A and 3B show the nucleotide sequence of the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase gene and flanking regions. The consensus ribosome-binding site lies approximately 10 bases upstream (double-underlined letters) from the putative translation initiation codon (positions  1  to  3 ). A rho-independent termination sequence lies at positions  1758  to  1790  (double-underlined letters). A putative TPP-binding site appears between positions  1351  and  1437 .  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCES  \\n     [0016] SEQ ID NOS. 1-3 are the known parts of the nucleotide sequence for the formyl-CoA transferase gene (also shown in FIG. 2).  \\n     [0017] SEQ ID NO. 4 is a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO. 1, which can be used according to the subject invention.  \\n     [0018] SEQ ID NO. 5 is a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO. 2, which can be used according to the subject invention.  \\n     [0019] SEQ ID NO. 6 is the nucleotide sequence for the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase gene (also shown in FIG. 3).  \\n     [0020] SEQ ID NO. 7 is a polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO. 6, which can be used according to the subject invention.  \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     [0021] The subject invention provides an accurate, sensitive assay for oxalate in biological samples such as urine and serum. Elevated levels of oxalate are correlated with urinary tract stone formation, as well as other health problems. Early detection of high levels of oxalate makes it possible to prevent, delay or reduce adverse health consequences through appropriate medication and through modulation of diet.  \\n     [0022] In the presently described diagnostic system, two enzymes are used to catabolize oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. Specifically, any oxalate that may be present in a sample being assayed is converted into formate and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) through the combined action of the enzymes oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase. The formate can then be detected using a variety of techniques known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the production of formate is measured calorimetrically by linking the catabolism of formate with the production of a detectable color change (for example, the formation of a compound that absorbs a particular wavelength of light). The production of formate is directly correlated with the amount of oxalate present in the sample. Therefore, if a known amount of formate is produced using the subject enzyme system, then the amount of oxalate present in the sample can be easily quantitated.  \\n     [0023] In a preferred embodiment, the enzymes used in the subject invention are expressed by genes from the bacterium  Oxalobacter formigenes.  The genes encoding both oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (Lung, 1994) and formyl-CoA transferase enzymes have been cloned and expressed, thus providing a readily-available source of reagent material. The subject assay is capable of detecting oxalate levels in a range as low as 0.00025-0.0005 mM (FIG. 1). This level of sensitivity makes the subject assay capable of direct detection of oxalate in serum samples consisting of little as 10 \u03bcl volume. The described system can be easily automated with standard systems known in the art.  \\n     [0024] In a preferred embodiment of the subject assay, the enzymatic reaction can be carried out in the wells of flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates and read in an automated plate reader. Suitable concentrations of the assay reagents oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, oxalyl-CoA, \u03b2-NAD, formate dehydrogenase, and the sample to be assayed are added to the microtiter wells. The reaction is then brought to equilibrium (two minute incubation at 37\u00b0 centigrade in the plate reader) to permit degradation of any residual formate that may be present in the sample. The formyl-CoA transferase enzyme is then added to the mixture to start the reaction, and the plate is read at 15 second intervals. Formate production is determined by measuring the reduction in NAD in the presence of formate dehydrogenase by detecting changes in absorbance of the sample at 340 nm (Baetz and Allison, 1989). The quantity of oxalate is determined by comparison of the unknown samples with standards having a known amount of oxalate.  \\n     [0025] Further, the enzymatic reaction of the subject assay will not be initiated until the formyl-CoA transferase, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, and oxalyl-CoA are all present within the reaction mixture. Therefore, initiation of the enzymatic reaction can be prevented by withholding one of the above reagents from the reaction mix. Preferably, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and oxalyl-CoA are added first, and the reaction is initiated by the addition of formyl-CoA transferase to the mix. However, the order of addition of the three reagents is not material to the function of the assay, so long as one of the reagents is withheld until just prior to the desired initiation point of the assay.  \\n     [0026] The formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase enzyme used in the subject invention can be obtained and purified as a natural product of  Oxalobacter formigenes  (Baetz and Allison, 1989 and 1990). Alternatively, the enzymes can be obtained from host cells expressing the recombinant polynucleotide molecules of the subject invention that encode the enzymes. Other reagents used in the subject assay can be obtained from conventional sources, such as Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo. Further, a person of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the optimal concentrations of the reagents to use in the assay described herein.  \\n     [0027] A further aspect of the subject invention concerns the cloning, sequencing and expression of the  Oxalobacter formigenes  gene which encodes the formyl-CoA transferase used in the assay that is a subject of the invention. The gene was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide probes (based on partial amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides) to screen an Oxalobacter genomic DNA library. The gene encodes a polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 40 kD. The subject invention further concerns the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene which encodes oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase from  Oxalobacter formigenes.  The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase are shown in FIGS. 2 and 3A and  3 B, respectively (SEQ ID NOS. 1-3 and 6).  \\n     [0028] Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, a variety of different polynucleotide sequences can encode the formyl-CoA transferase polypeptide disclosed herein. It is well within the skill of a person trained in the art to create alternative polynucleotide sequences encoding the same, or essentially the same, polypeptide of the subject invention. These variant or alternative polynucleotide sequences are within the scope of the subject invention. As used herein, references to \u201cessentially the same\u201d sequence refers to sequences which encode amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or insertions which do not materially alter the functional enzymatic activity of the encoded polypeptide. Further, the subject invention contemplates those polynucleotide molecules having sequences which are sufficiently homologous with the DNA sequences shown in FIGS. 2 and 3A and  3 B (SEQ ID NOS. 1-3 and 6) so as to permit hybridization with those sequences under standard high-stringency conditions. Such hybridization conditions are conventional in the art (see, e.g., Maniatis et al., 1989).  \\n     [0029] As a person skilled in the art would appreciate, certain amino acid substitutions within the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide can be made without altering the functional activity of the enzyme. For example, amino acids may be placed in the following classes: non-polar, uncharged polar, basic, and acidic. Conservative substitutions, whereby an amino acid of one class is replaced with another amino acid of the same class, fall within the scope of the subject invention so long as the substitution does not materially alter the enzymatic reactivity of the polypeptide. Non-conservative substitutions are also contemplated as long as the substitution does not significantly alter the functional activity of the encoded polypeptide.  \\n     [0030] The polynucleotides of the subject invention can be used to express the recombinant formyl-CoA transferase enzyme. They can also be used as a probe to detect related enzymes. The polynucleotides can also be used as DNA sizing standards.  \\n     [0031] The polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides can be used to raise an immunogenic response to the formyl-CoA transferase enzyme. They can also be used as molecular weight standards, or as inert protein in an assay. The polypeptides can also be used to detect the presence of antibodies immunoreactive with the enzyme.  \\n     [0032] The polynucleotide sequences of the subject invention may be composed of either RNA or DNA. More preferably, the polynucleotide sequences are composed of DNA.  \\n     [0033] Another aspect of the subject invention pertains to kits for carrying out the enzyme assay for oxalate. In one embodiment, the kit comprises, in packaged combination and in relative quantities to optimize the sensitivity of the described assay method, (a) the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, oxalyl-CoA, P-NAD, and formate dehydrogenase; and (b) formyl-CoA transferase. The kit may optionally include other reagents or solutions, such as buffering and stabilization agents, along with any other reagents that may be required for a particular signal generation system. Other reagents such as positive and negative controls can be included in the kit to provide for convenience and standardization of the assay method.  \\n     [0034] Following are examples which illustrate procedures, including the best mode, for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.  \\n     EXAMPLE 1  \\n     [0035] Determination of Level of Sensitivity of Enzyme Assay System  \\n     [0036] Samples containing oxalate at concentrations ranging from 0.004 mM to 0.00025 mM were prepared in 10 \u03bcl volumes. The samples were then assayed using the enzyme system of the subject invention in 96-well microtiter plates. Reagents were then added at the following concentrations: KH 2 PO 4  (pH 6.7), 50 mM; MgCl 2 , 5 mM; thiamine PPi (TPP), 2 mM; oxalyl-CoA, 0.375 mM; \u03b2-NAD, 1.0 mM; formate dehydrogenase, 0.25 IU; and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, 0.03 U. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes in order to permit the degradation of any residual formate that may be present in the sample mixture. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of formyl-CoA transferase to the sample mixture. Changes in A 340  were measured every 15 seconds at 37\u00b0 C. (FIGS. 1A and 1E). Appropriate positive and negative controls were run simultaneously with the assay.  \\n     [0037] It should be understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims.  \\n     [0038] References  \\n     [0039] Baetz, A.

No. 08/262,424, filed Jun. 20, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,111. </p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <summary-of-invention>\\n      <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0002\" num=\"0002\">[0002] The present invention relates to novel assay methods for determining the presence or concentration of oxalate in a sample. The present invention further relates to the cloning, sequencing and expression of formyl-CoA transferase, an enzyme used in the novel assay for the detection of oxalate. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0003\" num=\"0003\">[0003] Oxalic acid (Oxalate) is a highly toxic natural by-product of catabolism in vertebrate animals and many consumable plants. Unfortunately, a significant portion of humans are unable to properly metabolizing oxalate, a condition which may result in the formation of kidney stones in those persons. It is estimated that 70% of all kidney stones are composed of some amount of oxalate. Approximately 12 percent of the U.S. population will suffer from a kidney stone at some time in their lives, and the incidence is rising not only in the United States, but also in Sweden and Japan (Curhan, 1993). Moreover, although a healthy person breaks down or excretes sufficient quantities of oxalate to avoid excessive accumulation of oxalate in the tissues, a number of disease states are known to be associated with malfunctions of oxalate metabolism, including pyridoxine deficiency, renal failure and primary hyperoxaluria, a metabolic genetic disorder that results in the excessive deposition of oxalate in the kidneys. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] Persons suffering from and at risk for developing kidney stones, as well as patients with lipid malabsorption problems (e.g., sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory intestinal disease, bowel resection, etc.), tend to have elevated levels of urinary oxalate, a fact that has been exploited as a means for identifying individuals at risk. While elevated levels of oxalate may be present in urine, detecting elevated levels of oxalate in serum has not been routine due to the difficulty in detecting the low levels of oxalate present in serum. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] Most previous methods for measuring oxalate in a biological sample first require the isolation of the oxalate by precipitation, solvent extraction, or an ion-exchange absorption (Hodgkinson, 1970). Quantitation of the isolated oxalate may be determined by any one of several methods including colorimetry, fluorometry, gas-liquid chromatography or isotope dilution techniques. Because many of the oxalate isolation techniques used in these analytical methods are not quantitative, it is normally necessary to correct for the low recovery of oxalate by adding a <sup>14</sup>C-labeled oxalic acid internal standard, which further complicates the analytical method. All these methods are laborious, and consequently expensive because of the amount of skilled laboratory technician time which must be employed. In addition, isolation of the oxalate may require relatively large sample volumes for starting material. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] Recently, several advances in the detection and quantitation of oxalate have been made through the use of (a) oxalate degrading enzymes and (b) high performance liquid chromatography. One commercially-available enzymatic test (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.) employs oxalate oxidase to oxidize oxalate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced can then be measured colorimetrically in a second enzymatic reaction in the presence of peroxidase. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] In another enzymatic method for measuring oxalate, oxalate decarboxylase is used to convert oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. The resultant carbon dioxide can be measured manometrically, by the pH change in a carbon dioxide trapping buffer or by the color change in a pH indicator buffer. Whatever method of carbon dioxide assay is adopted, the time required for diffusion and equilibration of carbon dioxide is much longer than is desirable for a rapid analytical method. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008] Alternatively, the formate produced by the action of oxalate decarboxylase can be assayed with formate dehydrogenase in an NAD/NADH coupled reaction, as described in Costello, 1976 and Yriberri, 1980. This method is both cumbersome and time-consuming because oxalate decarboxylase and formate dehydrogenase differ in their optimum pH requirements, thus necessitating a pH adjustment during the analysis. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] Another commercially available enzymatic test (Boehringer Mannheim) cleaves oxalate to formate and carbon dioxide, then oxidizes the formate to bicarbonate by NAD in the presence of the enzyme formate dehydrogenase. The amount of NADH is determined by means of its absorbance at 334, 340, or 365 nm. Another test (\u201cSTONE RISK\u201d by Mission Pharmacal) measures oxalate as a part of a battery of tests for kidney stones. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010] As illustrated above, the currently existing assays for oxalate suffer from numerous problems, including cost, inaccuracy, reliability, complexity, and lack of sensitivity. Accordingly, it is an object of the subject invention to provide a simple, accurate, and sensitive assay for the detection of low levels of oxalate in a biological sample. </p>\\n      <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011] The subject invention concerns the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the formyl-CoA transferase and the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase genes of <i>Oxalobacter formigenes, </i>and the use of the enzymes to detect the presence of oxalate in a sample. The assay of the subject invention provides, for the first time, a rapid, sensitive method to detect even very low concentrations of oxalate in biological samples. Advantageously, the biological samples in which oxalate can be detected include both urine and serum samples. The enzyme system used according to the subject invention converts oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. In a preferred embodiment of the subject invention, the production of formate is then measured calorimetrically. This assay provides a sensitive, accurate and convenient means for detecting oxalate. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012] A further aspect of the subject invention is the discovery of the <i>O. formigenes </i>genes which encode the formyl-CoA transferase and the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase enzymes. The discovery of these genes makes it possible to efficiently produce large quantities of pure formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase for use in the assay of the subject invention or other appropriate application. </p>\\n    </summary-of-invention>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE FIGURES </heading>\\n    <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013] FIGS. <b>1</b>A-E show the detection of varying concentrations of oxalate in a sample.

Elevated levels of oxalate are correlated with urinary tract stone formation, as well as other health problems. Early detection of high levels of oxalate makes it possible to prevent, delay or reduce adverse health consequences through appropriate medication and through modulation of diet. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0022\" num=\"0022\">[0022] In the presently described diagnostic system, two enzymes are used to catabolize oxalate to carbon dioxide and formate. Specifically, any oxalate that may be present in a sample being assayed is converted into formate and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) through the combined action of the enzymes oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase. The formate can then be detected using a variety of techniques known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the production of formate is measured calorimetrically by linking the catabolism of formate with the production of a detectable color change (for example, the formation of a compound that absorbs a particular wavelength of light). The production of formate is directly correlated with the amount of oxalate present in the sample. Therefore, if a known amount of formate is produced using the subject enzyme system, then the amount of oxalate present in the sample can be easily quantitated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0023\" num=\"0023\">[0023] In a preferred embodiment, the enzymes used in the subject invention are expressed by genes from the bacterium <i>Oxalobacter formigenes. </i>The genes encoding both oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (Lung, 1994) and formyl-CoA transferase enzymes have been cloned and expressed, thus providing a readily-available source of reagent material. The subject assay is capable of detecting oxalate levels in a range as low as 0.00025-0.0005 mM (FIG. 1). This level of sensitivity makes the subject assay capable of direct detection of oxalate in serum samples consisting of little as 10 \u03bcl volume. The described system can be easily automated with standard systems known in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0024\" num=\"0024\">[0024] In a preferred embodiment of the subject assay, the enzymatic reaction can be carried out in the wells of flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates and read in an automated plate reader. Suitable concentrations of the assay reagents oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, oxalyl-CoA, \u03b2-NAD, formate dehydrogenase, and the sample to be assayed are added to the microtiter wells. The reaction is then brought to equilibrium (two minute incubation at 37\u00b0 centigrade in the plate reader) to permit degradation of any residual formate that may be present in the sample. The formyl-CoA transferase enzyme is then added to the mixture to start the reaction, and the plate is read at 15 second intervals. Formate production is determined by measuring the reduction in NAD in the presence of formate dehydrogenase by detecting changes in absorbance of the sample at 340 nm (Baetz and Allison, 1989). The quantity of oxalate is determined by comparison of the unknown samples with standards having a known amount of oxalate. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0025\" num=\"0025\">[0025] Further, the enzymatic reaction of the subject assay will not be initiated until the formyl-CoA transferase, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, and oxalyl-CoA are all present within the reaction mixture. Therefore, initiation of the enzymatic reaction can be prevented by withholding one of the above reagents from the reaction mix. Preferably, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and oxalyl-CoA are added first, and the reaction is initiated by the addition of formyl-CoA transferase to the mix. However, the order of addition of the three reagents is not material to the function of the assay, so long as one of the reagents is withheld until just prior to the desired initiation point of the assay. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0026\" num=\"0026\">[0026] The formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase enzyme used in the subject invention can be obtained and purified as a natural product of <i>Oxalobacter formigenes </i>(Baetz and Allison, 1989 and 1990). Alternatively, the enzymes can be obtained from host cells expressing the recombinant polynucleotide molecules of the subject invention that encode the enzymes. Other reagents used in the subject assay can be obtained from conventional sources, such as Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo. Further, a person of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the optimal concentrations of the reagents to use in the assay described herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0027\" num=\"0027\">[0027] A further aspect of the subject invention concerns the cloning, sequencing and expression of the <i>Oxalobacter formigenes </i>gene which encodes the formyl-CoA transferase used in the assay that is a subject of the invention. The gene was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide probes (based on partial amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides) to screen an Oxalobacter genomic DNA library. The gene encodes a polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 40 kD. The subject invention further concerns the cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene which encodes oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase from <i>Oxalobacter formigenes. </i>The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of formyl-CoA transferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase are shown in FIGS. 2 and 3A and <b>3</b>B, respectively (SEQ ID NOS. 1-3 and 6). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0028\" num=\"0028\">[0028] Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, a variety of different polynucleotide sequences can encode the formyl-CoA transferase polypeptide disclosed herein. It is well within the skill of a person trained in the art to create alternative polynucleotide sequences encoding the same, or essentially the same, polypeptide of the subject invention. These variant or alternative polynucleotide sequences are within the scope of the subject invention. As used herein, references to \u201cessentially the same\u201d sequence refers to sequences which encode amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or insertions which do not materially alter the functional enzymatic activity of the encoded polypeptide. Further, the subject invention contemplates those polynucleotide molecules having sequences which are sufficiently homologous with the DNA sequences shown in FIGS. 2 and 3A and <b>3</b>B (SEQ ID NOS. 1-3 and 6) so as to permit hybridization with those sequences under standard high-stringency conditions. Such hybridization conditions are conventional in the art (see, e.g., Maniatis et al., 1989). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0029\" num=\"0029\">[0029] As a person skilled in the art would appreciate, certain amino acid substitutions within the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide can be made without altering the functional activity of the enzyme. For example, amino acids may be placed in the following classes: non-polar, uncharged polar, basic, and acidic. Conservative substitutions, whereby an amino acid of one class is replaced with another amino acid of the same class, fall within the scope of the subject invention so long as the substitution does not materially alter the enzymatic reactivity of the polypeptide. Non-conservative substitutions are also contemplated as long as the substitution does not significantly alter the functional activity of the encoded polypeptide. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0030\" num=\"0030\">[0030] The polynucleotides of the subject invention can be used to express the recombinant formyl-CoA transferase enzyme. They can also be used as a probe to detect related enzymes. The polynucleotides can also be used as DNA sizing standards. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0031\" num=\"0031\">[0031] The polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides can be used to raise an immunogenic response to the formyl-CoA transferase enzyme. They can also be used as molecular weight standards, or as inert protein in an assay. The polypeptides can also be used to detect the presence of antibodies immunoreactive with the enzyme. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0032\" num=\"0032\">[0032] The polynucleotide sequences of the subject invention may be composed of either RNA or DNA. More preferably, the polynucleotide sequences are composed of DNA. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0033\" num=\"0033\">[0033] Another aspect of the subject invention pertains to kits for carrying out the enzyme assay for oxalate. In one embodiment, the kit comprises, in packaged combination and in relative quantities to optimize the sensitivity of the described assay method, (a) the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, oxalyl-CoA, P-NAD, and formate dehydrogenase; and (b) formyl-CoA transferase. The kit may optionally include other reagents or solutions, such as buffering and stabilization agents, along with any other reagents that may be required for a particular signal generation system. Other reagents such as positive and negative controls can be included in the kit to provide for convenience and standardization of the assay method. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0034\" num=\"0034\">[0034] Following are examples which illustrate procedures, including the best mode, for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting.

The samples were then assayed using the enzyme system of the subject invention in 96-well microtiter plates. Reagents were then added at the following concentrations: KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(pH 6.7), 50 mM; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM; thiamine PPi (TPP), 2 mM; oxalyl-CoA, 0.375 mM; \u03b2-NAD, 1.0 mM; formate dehydrogenase, 0.25 IU; and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, 0.03 U. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 minutes in order to permit the degradation of any residual formate that may be present in the sample mixture. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of formyl-CoA transferase to the sample mixture. Changes in A<sub>340 </sub>were measured every 15 seconds at 37\u00b0 C. (FIGS. 1A and 1E). Appropriate positive and negative controls were run simultaneously with the assay. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0037\" num=\"0037\">[0037] It should be understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0038\" num=\"0038\">[0038] References </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0039\" num=\"0039\">[0039] Baetz, A.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0001] The present invention relates to methods of producing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material, a negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode.  \\n       [0002] Recently, various portable electronic devices such as a camera integrated video tape recorder, a cellular phone, and a laptop computer have been widely available. These portable electronic devices have come to be further required to be reduced in size and weight, and to meet such a requirement, studies have been actively made to enhance the energy density of batteries, particularly, secondary batteries used as portable power sources of these portable electronic devices. In particular, lithium ion secondary batteries capable of acquiring a large energy density as compared with conventional non-aqueous electrolyte batteries such as a lead battery and a nickel-cadmium battery have been increasingly expected to be useful as the above portable power sources.  \\n       [0003] By the way, a carbon material such as difficult-graphitization carbon or graphite has been widely used as a negative electrode material used for lithium ion secondary batteries. This is because such a carbon material exhibits a relatively high charging/discharging capacity and realizes a good cycle characteristic.  \\n       [0004] Along with the recent tendency toward higher charging/discharging capacity, however, the above-described carbon material has become insufficient in charging/discharging capacity, and therefore, it has been required to develop a negative electrode material having a further improved performance. For example, studies have been made to develop a non-carbon (typically, silicon or tin) based negative electrode material having a higher charging/discharging capacity in place of the above-described carbon material, and further, studies have been made to develop a negative electrode material using a mixture of such a non-carbon material and a carbon material, a negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode.  \\n       [0005] The above-described negative electrode material, negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode, however, have a problem that since powders of a non-carbon material and a carbon material used as the negative electrode material absorb moisture in atmospheric air during the production process, there may occur degradation of the quality and a danger of dust explosion and/or firing.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006] An object of the present invention is to provide a high quality negative electrode material, a negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode by safe methods.  \\n       [0007] To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material, including the step of: pulverizing and classifying each of the non-carbon material and the carbon material in an inert gas atmosphere.  \\n       [0008] With this configuration, since each of the non-carbon material and the carbon material is pulverized and classified in an inert gas atmosphere poor in reactivity and incombustible, it is possible to prevent occurrence of firing of powders of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, and hence to safely produce the negative electrode material.  \\n       [0009] According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of producing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material, including the step of: mixing the non-carbon material and the carbon material in an inert gas atmosphere.  \\n       [0010] With this configuration, since the non-carbon material and the carbon material are mixed to each other in an inert gas atmosphere poor in reactivity and incombustible, it is possible to prevent occurrence of firing of powders of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, and hence to safely produce the negative electrode material.  \\n       [0011] According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of producing a negative electrode by applying a negative electrode black mix containing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material on a negative electrode collector and drying the negative electrode black mix, including the step of: applying the negative electrode black mix on the negative electrode collector and drying it in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere.  \\n       [0012] With this configuration, since the negative electrode black mix containing the negative electrode material composed of the mixture of the non-carbon material and the carbon material is applied on the negative electrode collector and is dried in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere, it is possible to prevent absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode material when the negative electrode black mix is applied on the negative electrode collector and is dried, and hence to produce the high quality negative electrode without degradation of the quality.  \\n       [0013] According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of producing a negative electrode using a negative electrode black mix containing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material, including the step of: hot-pressing the negative electrode black mix.  \\n       [0014] With this configuration, since the negative electrode black mix is hot-pressed, it is possible to prevent absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode material in the negative electrode black mix when the negative electrode black mix is pressed, and to uniformly bond the non-carbon material and the carbon material to each other, and hence to produce the high quality negative electrode without degradation of the quality.  \\n       [0015] According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of producing a non-aqueous electrolyte battery, including a positive electrode containing a lithium composite oxide; a negative electrode containing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material in or from which lithium is doped or released and a carbon material, the negative electrode being disposed opposite to the positive electrode; and a non-aqueous electrolyte interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, the method including the step of: winding the negative electrode into a wound body in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere.  \\n       [0016] With this configuration, since the negative electrode is wound into a wound body in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere, it is possible to prevent absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode material when the negative electrode is wound, and hence to produce the high quality negative electrode without degradation of the quality.  \\n       [0017] According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of producing a non-aqueous electrolyte battery, including a positive electrode containing a lithium composite oxide; a negative electrode containing a negative electrode material composed of a mixture of a non-carbon material in or from which lithium is doped or released and a carbon material, the negative electrode being disposed opposite to the positive electrode; and a non-aqueous electrolytic solution used as a non-aqueous electrolyte interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, the method including the step of: pouring the non-aqueous electrolytic solution in the non-aqueous electrolyte battery in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere.  \\n       [0018] With this configuration, since the non-aqueous electrolytic solution used as the non-aqueous electrolyte is poured in the non-aqueous electrolyte battery in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere, it is possible to prevent absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the non-aqueous electrolytic solution when the non-aqueous electrolytic solution is poured in the non-aqueous electrolyte battery, and hence to produce the high quality negative electrode without degradation of the quality.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0019]FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing one configuration example of a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery to which the present invention is applied; and  \\n     [0020]FIG. 2 is a sectional view showing one configuration example of a coin-type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery to which the present invention is applied. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  \\n     [0021] Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.  \\n     [0022]FIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view showing one configuration example of a non-aqueous electrolyte battery according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  is produced by closely stacking a film-like positive electrode  2  and a film-like negative electrode  3  with a separator  4  put therebetween and winding the stack to form a wound body, putting the wound body in a battery container  5 , and pouring a non-aqueous electrolytic solution used as an electrolyte in the battery container  5 .  \\n     [0023] The positive electrode  2  is produced by applying a positive electrode black mix containing a positive active material and a binder on a positive electrode collector, and drying the positive electrode black mix, to form a positive active material layer on the positive electrode collector. A metal foil, typically, an aluminum foil is used as the positive electrode collector.  \\n     [0024] The positive active material may be selected from metal oxides, metal sulfides, and specific polymers depending on the kind of battery to be produced.  \\n     [0025] For example, the positive active material used for lithium primary batteries may be selected from TiS 2 , MnO 2 , graphite, and FeS 2 , and the positive active material used for lithium secondary batteries may be selected from metal sulfides and metal oxides such as TiS 2 , MOS 2 , NbSe 2 , and V 2 O 5 .  \\n     [0026] Further, as the positive active material used for lithium secondary batteries, there may be used a lithium composite oxide expressed by a chemical formula Li x MO 2  where M is one kind or more transition metals, and x is a value depending on a charging/discharging state and is generally in a range of 0.05\u2266x\u22661.10. The transition metal M contained in the lithium composite oxide is preferably selected from Co, Ni, and Mn. Specific examples of the lithium composite oxides may include LiCoO 2 , LiNiO 2 , Li x Ni y CO 1\u2212y O 2  (x and y are values depending on the charging/discharging state of the battery, generally, 0&lt;x&lt;1 and 0.7&lt;y&lt;1.02), and LiMn 2 O 4 .  \\n     [0027] The above-described lithium composite oxide is capable of generating a high voltage, and therefore, it becomes a positive active material excellent in terms of energy density. A plurality of these positive active materials may be used in combination for the positive electrode  2 .  \\n     [0028] The binder contained in the above-described positive electrode black mix may be a known binder generally used for a positive electrode black mix of a battery of this type, and a known additive may be added to the positive electrode black mix.  \\n     [0029] The negative electrode  3  is produced by applying a negative electrode black mix containing a negative active material and a binder on a negative electrode collector, and drying the negative electrode black mix, to form a negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector. A metal foil, typically, a copper foil is used as the negative electrode collector.  \\n     [0030] In the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  according to this embodiment, a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material is used as the negative active material.  \\n     [0031] As the non-carbon material, there may be used a material forming, together with lithium, an alloy expressed by a chemical formula Li x MM\u2032 where M and M\u2032 are elements other than Li and C, and x is in a range of x\u22670.01. Specific examples of the non-carbon materials may include a silicon compound, a tin compound, an indium compound, and an aluminum compound.  \\n     [0032] If one of M and M\u2032 is an element (such as silicon, tin, indium or aluminum) forming, together with lithium, an alloy expressed by a chemical formula Li x M or Li x M\u2032 (M and M\u2032 are elements other than Li and C, and x is in a range of x\u22670.01) then the other one of M and M\u2032 may be a non-carbon element being inactive with lithium.  \\n     [0033] The value x in the above chemical formula specified to be in the range of x\u22670.01 as described above is preferably in a range of x\u22670.1.  \\n     [0034] As the silicon compound, there may be used a compound expressed by a chemical formula M x Si where M is an element other than Li and Si, for example, B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Y, Mo, Rh, Pd, In, Sn, Cs, Ba, Ce, or Ta.  \\n     [0035] As the carbon material, there may be widely used a difficult-graphitization carbon material having a spacing between (002) planes in a range of 0.37 nm or more, a graphite based carbon material having a spacing between the (002) planes in a range of 0.340 nm or less, or an easy-graphitization carbon material.  \\n     [0036] Specific examples of the carbon materials may include pyrolytic carbons, cokes such as pitch coke, needle coke, petroleum coke, graphites, vitreous carbons, baked bodies of organic high polymer compounds, carbon fibers, and activated charcoals. Additionally, the above baked body of an organic high polymer compound is typically produced by baking phenol resin or furan resin at a suitable temperature so as to carbonize the resin.  \\n     [0037] The above-described carbon materials may be used singly or in combination. In particular, it may be desirable to use at least the difficult-graphitization carbon material, to which the easy-graphitization carbon material or graphite based carbon material may be added at a suitable mixing ratio.  \\n     [0038] In the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 , a ratio of an average particle size R M  of the non-carbon material in the negative active material to an average particle size R C  of the carbon material in the negative active material is specified in a range of R M /R C \u22661. That is to say, the average particle size of the non-carbon material in the negative active material is made smaller than the average particle size of the carbon material in the negative active material. As a result, particles of the non-carbon material permeate gaps formed by particles of the carbon material having larger particle sizes.  \\n     [0039] To be more specific, according to the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  in this embodiment, in the negative electrode containing the non-carbon material and the carbon material, the gaps formed by particles of the carbon material having larger particle sizes are used as fields where lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material. Since lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material in the gaps formed by the particles of the carbon material, if there occurs a change in volume of the non-carbon material due to expansion or contraction of the non-carbon material when lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material, then the change in volume of the non-carbon material can be absorbed by the gaps formed by the particles of the carbon material. As a result, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the entire negative active material, and hence to significantly improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0040] If the ratio R M /R C  is larger than 1, that is, the average particle size of the non-carbon material is larger than the average particle size of the carbon material, then a change in volume of the non-carbon material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material cannot be absorbed by the carbon material. As described above, by specifying the ratio R M /R C  in the range of 1 or less, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the negative active material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material, and hence to improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0041] The average particle size R C  of the carbon material contained in the negative active material is preferably in a range of about 10 \u03bcm to 70 \u03bcm. The shape of the carbon material is not particularly limited but may be selected from various shapes such as a granular shape and a flake shape.  \\n     [0042] The average particle size R M  of the non-carbon material contained in the negative active material is preferably in a range of about 20 \u03bcm or less, more preferably, in a range of about 10 \u03bcm or less.  \\n     [0043] The particle sizes and the average particle size of each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material will be described below. In this embodiment, the method of measuring the particle sizes and the average particle size of each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material is not particularly limited but may be any one of various known methods of measuring the sizes of particles having irregular shapes insofar as the ratio R M /R C  is in the range of 1 or less.  \\n     [0044] For example, as the method of measuring the particle sizes, there may be adopted a method of sieving particles and determining the size of the particles on the base of the mesh of a sieve through which the particles do not pass, or a method of settling particles in a liquid, measuring the settling rate of the particles, and determining the size (Stokes&#39; diameters) of the particles by using the Stokes&#39; equation. In addition, the Stokes&#39; diameter indicates a diameter of a spherical particle which has the same density as that of a sample particle and which is settled at the same setting rate as that of the sample particle under the same condition.  \\n     [0045] By the way, powders generally have a distribution of particles sizes, and if such powders having a distribution of particles sizes are regarded to be substantially the same as powders having uniform particle sizes R in term of an effect exerted on a certain phenomenon, then it is convenient to use the particle size R of the powders as the typical particle size thereof. The particle size R of powders is called an average particle size thereof. Accordingly, the determination of the average particle size of powders differs depending on the purpose of the powders. For example, the average particle size of powders may be determined, but not limited thereto, on the basis of an equation of \u03a3nR/\u03a3n where R is the particle size of each particle and n is the number of particles.  \\n     [0046] With respect to the mixture of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, a ratio of a weight W M  of the non-carbon material to a weight W C  of the carbon material is preferably in a range of W M /W C \u22661. The reason for this is as follows: namely, in the case where the existing ratio of the non-carbon material is more than 50%, even if there appears a change in volume of the non-carbon material due to expansion or contraction thereof caused by doping or release in or from the non-carbon material, then there is a possibility that the change in volume of the non-carbon material cannot be absorbed by the gaps of particles of the carbon material and thereby a change in volume of the entire negative active material cannot be suppressed. As a result, it fails to improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0047] The non-aqueous electrolytic solution is prepared by dissolving an electrolyte in a non-aqueous solvent.  \\n     [0048] The electrolyte may be a known electrolyte generally used for a battery of this type. Specific examples of the electrolytes may include lithium salts such as LiClO 4 , LiAsF 6 , LiPF 6 , LiBF 4 , LiB(C 6 H 5 ) 4 , CH 3 SO 3 Li, CF 3 SO 3 Li, LiCl, and LiBr.  \\n     [0049] The non-aqueous solvent may be a known non-aqueous solvent generally used for a non-aqueous electrolytic solution. Specific examples of the non-aqueous solvents may include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, 1,2-dimethoxy ethane, 1,2-diethoxy ethane, \u03b3-butyrolactone, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxosilane, 4-methy-1,3-dioxosilane, diethyl ether, sulfolane, methyl sulfolane, acetonitrile, propionitrile, anisole, acetic ester, butyric ester, and propionic ester. These non-aqueous solvents may be used singly or in combination.  \\n     [0050] The cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  is significantly improved by specifying a ratio in particle size between the silicon compound and the carbon material contained in the negative electrode, thereby suppressing a change in volume of the negative active material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the silicon compound.  \\n     [0051] A method of producing the above-described non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  will be described below.  \\n     [0052] The positive electrode  2  is produced by uniformly applying a positive electrode black mix containing a positive active material and a binder on a metal foil typically an aluminum foil as a positive electrode collector and drying the positive electrode black mix, to form a positive active material layer on a positive electrode collector. The binder of the positive electrode black mix may be a known binder, and a known additive may be added to the positive electrode black mix.  \\n     [0053] The negative electrode  3  is provided by pulverizing and classifying each of a non-carbon material and a carbon material to prepare a powder of the non-carbon material and a powder of the carbon material, mixing these powders with each other to produce a negative electrode material composed of the mixture of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, mixing a binder with the negative electrode material to produce a negative electrode black mix, uniformly applying the negative electrode black mix on a metal foil typically an aluminum foil as a negative electrode collector and drying the negative electrode black mix to form a negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector, and compressing the negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector by hot-pressing. The binder of the negative electrode black mix may be a known binder, and a known additive may be added to the negative electrode black mix.  \\n     [0054] The step of pulverizing and classifying each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material is performed in an inert gas atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent occurrence of accidents such as dust explosion and firing, and hence to safely perform the pulverizing/classifying work.  \\n     [0055] The step of mixing the carbon material and the non-carbon material with each other is performed in an inert gas atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent occurrence of accidents such as dust explosion and firing, and hence to safely perform the mixing work.  \\n     [0056] The step of applying the negative electrode black mix on the metal foil and drying the negative electrode black mix is performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode  3  from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode black mix and hence to produce the negative electrode  3  with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  with a high quality. It should be noted that the dry air atmosphere means a state in which a dew point is \u221210\u00b0 C. or less.  \\n     [0057] The above-described hot-pressing is performed at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. or more. Since the negative electrode black mix is compressed by hot-pressing to produce the negative electrode  3 , it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode  3  from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode black mix and to uniformly bond the non-carbon material layer and the carbon material layer to each other. Accordingly, by compressing the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing, it is possible to produce the negative electrode  3  with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  with a high quality. The hot-pressing is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. This makes it possible to further enhance the above-described hot-pressing effect. It should be noted that the dry air atmosphere means a state in which a dew point is \u221210\u00b0 C. or less.  \\n     [0058] The positive electrode  2  and the negative electrode  3  thus produced are closely stacked to each other with a separator  4 , which is formed of typically a polypropylene film having fine pores, put therebetween, and the stack is spirally wound by several times, to form a wound body.  \\n     [0059] The step of stacking and winding the positive electrode  2 , the separator  4 , and the negative electrode  3  is performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode  3  from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode black mix, and hence to produce the negative electrode  3  with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  with a high quality. It should be noted that the dry air atmosphere means a state in which a dew point is \u221210\u00b0 C. or less.  \\n     [0060] Next, an insulating plate  6  is inserted in a bottom portion of an iron made battery container  5  on the inner surface of which nickel plating is applied, and the wound body is contained in the battery container  5 . For current collection of the negative electrode  3 , one end of a negative electrode lead  7  made from typically nickel is crimped to the negative electrode  3  and the other end of the negative electrode lead  7  is welded to the battery container  5 . As a result, the battery container  5 , which is conducted to the negative electrode  3 , functions as an external negative electrode of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 . For current collection of the positive electrode  2 , one end of a positive electrode lead  8  made from typically aluminum is mounted to the positive electrode  2 , and the other end of the positive electrode  2  is electrically connected to a battery lid  10  via a current shielding thin plate  9  for shielding a current depending on an inner pressure of the battery. As a result, the battery lid  10 , which is conducted to the positive electrode  2 , functions as an external positive electrode of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0061] A non-aqueous electrolytic solution prepared by dissolving an electrolyte in a non-aqueous solvent is poured in the battery container  5 .  \\n     [0062] The step of pouring the non-aqueous electrolytic solution in the battery container  5  is performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode  3  from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the non-aqueous electrolytic solution, and hence to produce the negative electrode  3  with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  with a high quality. It should be noted that the dry air atmosphere means a state in which a dew point is \u221210\u00b0 C. or less.  \\n     [0063] The edge of the battery container  5  is then crimped on the battery lid  10  via an insulating sealing gasket  11  coated with asphalt, to fix the battery lid  10  to the battery container  5 , thereby producing the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  having a cylindrical shape.  \\n     [0064] As shown in FIG. 1, the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  is further provided with a center pin  12  connected to the negative electrode lead  7  and the positive electrode lead  8 , a safety valve device  13  for releasing a gas in the battery when an inner pressure of the battery becomes higher than a specific value, and a PTC element  14  for preventing the temperature rise in the battery.  \\n     [0065] In the above-described embodiment, the ratio in particle size between the non-carbon material and the carbon material in the negative active material of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  is described; however, a ratio in weight between the non-carbon material and the carbon material may be specified.  \\n     [0066] To be more specific, a ratio of a weight W M  of the non-carbon material contained in the negative active material to a weight W C  of the carbon material contained in the negative active material is set at a value in a range of W M /W C \u22661.  \\n     [0067] Since the weight of the carbon material is larger than that of the non-carbon material, even if there appears a change in volume of the non-carbon material due to expansion or contraction thereof caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material, then the change in volume of the non-carbon material can be absorbed by the carbon material having the weight larger than that of the non-carbon material. As a result, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the entire negative active material and hence to significantly improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0068] If the ratio W M /W C  is larger than 1, that is, the weight of the non-carbon material is larger than the weight of the carbon material, then a change in volume of the non-carbon material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material cannot be absorbed by the carbon material. As described above, by specifying the ratio W M /W C  in the range of 1 or less, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the negative active material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material, and hence to improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1 .  \\n     [0069] In the above-described embodiment, description is made by example of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery  1  using the non-aqueous electrolytic solution in which the electrolyte is dissolved in the non-aqueous solvent; however, the present invention can be applied to a battery using an organic or inorganic solid electrolyte, a solid electrolyte dispersed in a high polymer matrix, or a gel-like solid electrolyte containing a swelling solvent.  \\n     [0070] The shape of the battery of the present invention is not particularly limited but may be selected from various shapes such as a cylindrical shape, a square shape, coin shape, or button shape, and the size of the battery of the present invention is not particularly limited but may be selected from various sizes such as a thin size and a large size.  \\n     [0071] The present invention will be more clearly understood by way of the following examples:  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 1  \\n     [0072] To confirm the effect of the present invention, a coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery  20  shown in FIG. 2 was produced, and the characteristic thereof was evaluated.  \\n     [0073] First, a positive electrode  21  was produced as follows:  \\n     [0074] LiCoO 2  as a positive active material was obtained by mixing 0.5 mol of lithium carbonate and 1 mol of cobalt carbonate, and baking the mixture for 5 hr in air at 900\u00b0 C. The positive active material LiCoO 2  was pulverized and classified into a powder. Then, 91 parts by weight of LiCoO 2 , 6 parts by weight of graphite as a conductive material, and 3 parts by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder were mixed, followed by adding N-methyl pyrolidone as a dispersant thereto, to produce paste. The paste was dried and formed into in a disk-like shape, to obtain the positive electrode  21 .  \\n     [0075] A negative electrode  22  was produced as follows:  \\n     [0076] Petroleum pitch as a starting material was subjected to oxygen-crosslinking by introducing 10 to 20% of functional groups containing oxygen to the petroleum pitch, and the cross-linked petroleum pitch was baked in a flow of an insert gas at 1000\u00b0 C., to obtain a difficult-graphitization carbon material having a property close to that of vitreous carbon. The difficult-graphitization carbon material thus obtained was subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis. As a result, it was found that a spacing between (002) planes was 3.76 \u212b and the true specific gravity was 1.58 g/cm 3 .  \\n     [0077] The difficult-graphitization carbon material was pulverized into a powder (average particle size: 50 \u03bcm) of a carbon material. On the other hand, a silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) was pulverized and classified in a nitrogen atmosphere into a powder (average particle size: 5 \u03bcm) of a non-carbon material. Then, 60 parts by weight of the carbon material, 30 parts by weight of the non-carbon material, and 10 parts by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder were mixed in a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by adding N-methyl pyrolidone as a dispersant thereto, to prepare a negative electrode black mix. The negative electrode black mix was uniformly applied on both surfaces of a nickel mesh (diameter of nickel fiber: 20 \u03bcm) as a negative electrode collector and dried in a nitrogen atmosphere, to form a negative active material layer on the collector, and the negative active material layer was compressed on the collector in a nitrogen atmosphere by using a hot-pressing machine, to produce the negative electrode  22  having a disk-shape.  \\n     [0078] The positive electrode  21  was contained in a positive electrode container  23  made from aluminum, and the negative electrode  22  was contained in a negative electrode cup  24  made from a stainless steel (SUS304 specified in JIS). The positive electrode  21  and the negative electrode  22  were stacked to each other with a separator  25  made from polypropylene put therebetween.  \\n     [0079] A non-aqueous electrolytic solution was poured in the battery container composed of the positive electrode container  23  and the negative electrode cup  24  in atmospheric air. The non-aqueous electrolytic solution was prepared by dissolving LiPF 6  in a mixed solvent of 50 vol % of propylene carbonate and 50 vol % of diethyl carbonate at a concentration of 1.0 mol/L.  \\n     [0080] Subsequently, outer peripheral edges of the positive electrode container  23  and the negative electrode cup  24  were crimped to each other via a sealing gasket  26 , to enclose the battery container composed of the positive electrode container  23  and the negative electrode cup  24 , thereby producing a coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery  20  having a diameter 20 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm.  \\n     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1  \\n     [0081] An attempt was made to produce a coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) was pulverized and classified in atmospheric air.  \\n     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2  \\n     [0082] An attempt was made to produce a coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the powder of the carbon material was mixed with the powder of the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) in atmospheric air.  \\n     [0083] In Inventive Example 1, the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced without occurrence of any accident. On the contrary, in Comparative Example 1, the powder of the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) was fired during pulverization of the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si), thereby failing to produce the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, and in Comparative Example 2, the powder of the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) was fired during mixing of the powder of the carbon material with the silicon compound (Mg 2 Si), thereby failing to produce the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery.  \\n     [0084] As a result, it becomes apparent that by pulverizing and classifying the non-carbon material in an inert gas atmosphere, it is possible to prevent occurrence of firing of the metal powder constituting the non-carbon material and hence to safely perform the work of pulverizing and classifying the non-carbon material; and that by mixing a powder of the carbon material with a powder of the non-carbon material in an inert gas atmosphere, it is possible to prevent occurrence of firing of the metal powder constituting the non-carbon material and hence to safely perform the work of mixing the powder of the carbon material with the powder of the non-carbon material.  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 2  \\n     [0085] A coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the negative electrode black mix was applied on both the surfaces of the nickel mesh (diameter of nickel fiber: 20 \u03bcm) and dried in a dry air atmosphere having a dew point of \u221220\u00b0 C.  \\n     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3  \\n     [0086] A coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the negative electrode black mix was applied on both the surfaces of the nickel mesh (diameter of nickel fiber: 20 \u03bcm) and dried in atmospheric air.  \\n     [0087] The charging/discharging characteristics of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Example 3 were evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation method.  \\n     [0088] Evaluation Method for Charging/discharging Characteristic  \\n     [0089] Each of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries was charged at a constant-current/constant-potential of 1 A to an upper limit of 4.2 V and was discharged at a constant current of 500 mA to a termination voltage of 0.0 V, and a charging/discharging efficiency (%) of each battery was obtained on the basis of a ratio of the charging capacity to the discharging capacity. In addition, the charging/discharging characteristic evaluation test was performed in an environment at 20\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0090] The charging/discharging efficiencies of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Example 3 are shown in Table 1.  \\n                           TABLE 1                                   Applying/drying   Charging/discharging           Atmosphere   Efficiency (%)                                                Inventive Example 1   nitrogen atmosphere   88       Inventive Example 2   dry atmosphere   84       Comparative Example 3   atmospheric air   67                  \\n \\n     [0091] As is apparent from Table 1, in each of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 1 and 2 in which the negative electrode black mix was applied and dried in an inert gas atmosphere and a dry air atmosphere, respectively, the charging/discharging efficiency is significantly improved as compared with the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery in Comparative Example 3 in which the negative electrode black mix was applied and dried in atmospheric air. The reason for this may be considered as follows: namely, the step of applying and drying the negative electrode black mix in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere is effective to prevent occurrence of the inconvenience that the quality of the negative electrode is degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode material and thereby the essential performance of the negative electrode material cannot be attained.  \\n     [0092] As a result, it becomes apparent that by applying and drying the negative electrode black mix in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere, it is possible to prevent the degradation of the quality of the negative electrode and hence to obtain a good charging/discharging characteristic.  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 3  \\n     [0093] A coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the negative electrode black mix was compressed by the hot-pressing machine in a dry air atmosphere having a dew point of \u221220\u00b0 C.  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 4  \\n     [0094] A coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the negative electrode black mix was compressed by the hot-pressing machine in atmospheric air.  \\n     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4  \\n     [0095] A coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 1, except that the negative electrode black mix was compressed by a cold-pressing machine in atmospheric air.  \\n     [0096] The charging/discharging characteristics of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 3 and 4 and Comparative Example 4 were evaluated in accordance with the above-described evaluation method.  \\n     [0097] The charging/discharging efficiencies of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 1, 3 and 4 and Comparative Example 4 are shown in Table 2.  \\n                               TABLE 2                                   Pressing   Pressing   Charging/discharging           Condition   Atmosphere   Efficiency (%)                                                            Inventive   hot-pressing   nitrogen   91           Example 1       atmosphere           Inventive   hot-pressing   dry air   90           Example 3       atmosphere           Inventive   hot-pressing   atmospheric   88           Example 4       air           Comparative   cold-pressing   atmospheric           Example 4       air                      \\n \\n     [0098] As is apparent from Table 2, in each of the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 1, 3 and 4 in which the negative electrode black mix was compressed by hot-pressing in an inert gas atmosphere, a dry air atmosphere, and atmospheric air, respectively, the charging/discharging efficiency is significantly improved as compared with the coin type non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery in Comparative Example 4 in which the negative electrode black mix was compressed by cold-pressing in atmospheric air. The reason for this may be considered as follows: namely, the step of compressing the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing is effective to prevent occurrence of the inconvenience that the quality of the negative electrode is degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode material and thereby the essential performance of the negative electrode material cannot be attained. From the comparison between Inventive Examples 1, 3 and 4, it may be also considered that the compression of the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere is effective more than the compression of the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing in atmospheric air.  \\n     [0099] As a result, it becomes apparent that by compressing the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing, it is possible to prevent the degradation of the quality of the negative electrode and hence to obtain a good charging/discharging characteristic, and that by performing the hot-pressing in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere, it is possible to further increase the hot-pressing effect.  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 5  \\n     [0100] To confirm the effect of the present invention, a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery  1  shown in FIG. 1 was produced, and the characteristic thereof was evaluated.  \\n     [0101] First, a negative electrode  3  was produced as follows:  \\n     [0102] Petroleum pitch as a starting material was subjected to oxygen-crosslinking by introducing 10 to 20% of functional groups containing oxygen to the petroleum pitch, and the cross-linked petroleum pitch was baked in a flow of an insert gas at 1000\u00b0 C., to obtain a difficult-graphitization carbon material having a property close to that of vitreous carbon. The difficult-graphitization carbon material thus obtained was subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis. As a result, it was found that a spacing between (002) planes was 3.76 \u212b and the true specific gravity was 1.58 g/cm 3 .  \\n     [0103] The difficult-graphitization carbon material was pulverized into a powder (average particle size: 50 \u03bcm) of a carbon material. On the other hand, a silicon compound (Mg 2 Si) was pulverized and classified into a powder (average particle size: 5 \u03bcm) of a non-carbon material. Then, 60 parts by weight of the carbon material, 30 parts by weight of the non-carbon material, and 10 parts by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder were mixed in a nitrogen atmosphere, to prepare a negative electrode black mix.  \\n     [0104] The negative electrode black mix was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrolidone into slurry. The slurry was uniformly applied on both surfaces of a strip-shaped copper foil (thickness: 10 \u03bcm) as a negative electrode collector and dried, to form a negative active material layer on the collector, and the negative active material layer was compressed on the collector by using a pressing machine, to produce the negative electrode  3 .  \\n     [0105] A positive electrode  2  was produced as follows:  \\n     [0106] LiCoO 2  as a positive active material was obtained by mixing lithium carbonate and cobalt carbonate at a mixing ratio of 0.5 mol:1 mol, and baking the mixture for 5 hr in air at 900\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0107] Then, 91 parts by weight of LiCoO 2 , 6 parts by weight of graphite as a conductive material, and 3 parts by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride as a binder were mixed, to prepare a positive electrode black mix.  \\n     [0108] The positive electrode black mix was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrolidone into paste. The slurry was uniformly applied on both surfaces of an aluminum foil (thickness: 20 \u03bcm) as a positive electrode collector and dried, to form a positive active material layer on the collector, and the positive active material layer was compressed on the collector by a roll-pressing machine, to produce the positive electrode  2 .  \\n     [0109] In a glove box kept in a nitrogen atmosphere, the positive electrode  2  and the negative electrode  3  thus produced were closely stacked to each other with a separator  4 , formed of typically a polypropylene film having fine pores (thickness: 25 \u03bcm), put therebetween, and the stack was spirally wound by several times, to form a wound body.  \\n     [0110] An insulating plate  6  was inserted in a bottom portion of an iron made battery container  5  on the inner surface of which nickel plating was applied, and the wound body was contained in the battery container  5 . For current collection of the negative electrode  3 , one end of a negative electrode lead  7  made from nickel was crimped to the negative electrode  3  and the other end of the negative electrode lead  7  was welded to the battery container  5 . For current collection of the positive electrode  2 , one end of a positive electrode lead  8  made from aluminum was mounted to the positive electrode  2 , and the other end of the positive electrode  2  was electrically connected to a battery lid  10  via a current shielding thin plate  9  for shielding a current depending on an inner pressure of the battery.  \\n     [0111] A non-aqueous electrolytic solution, prepared by dissolving LiPF 6  in a mixed solvent of 50 vol % of propylene carbonate and 50 vol % of diethyl carbonate at a concentration of 1.0 mol/L, was poured in the battery container  5 .  \\n     [0112] Finally, the edge of the battery container  5  was crimped on the battery lid  10  via an insulating sealing gasket  11  coated with asphalt, to fix the battery lid  10  to the battery container  5 , thereby producing the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery having a cylindrical shape of about 18 mm in diameter and about 65 mm in height.  \\n     INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 6  \\n     [0113] A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 5, except that the electrode wound body was formed in a glove box kept in a dry air atmosphere having a dew point of \u221220\u00b0 C.  \\n     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5  \\n     [0114] A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery was produced in the same manner as that described in Inventive Example 5, except that the electrode wound body was formed in atmospheric air.  \\n     [0115] The cycle characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 5 and 6 and Comparative Example 5 were evaluated in the following evaluation method.  \\n     [0116] Evaluation Method for Cycle Characteristic  \\n     [0117] Each of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries was charged at a constant-current/constant-potential of 1 A to an upper limit of 4.2 V and was discharged at a constant current of 500 mA to a termination voltage of 2.5 V. This charging/discharging cycle was repeated by 100 times. A discharging capacity retention ratio (%) at the 100 cycle was obtained by a ratio of a discharging capacity at the 1 st  cycle to a discharging capacity at the 100 th  cycle. It should be noted that the cycle characteristic evaluation test was performed in an environment of 20\u00b0 C.  \\n     [0118] The discharging capacity retention ratios of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 5 and 6 and Comparative Example 5 are shown in Table 3. Additionally, with respect to the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 5 and 6 and Comparative Example 5, the initial capacities were nearly equal to each other.  \\n                           TABLE 3                                       Discharging Capacity           Winding Atmosphere   Retention Ratio (%)                                                Inventive Example 5   nitrogen atmosphere   95       Inventive Example 6   dry air atmosphere   93       Comparative Example 5   atmospheric air   78                  \\n \\n     [0119] As is apparent from Table 3, in each of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries in Inventive Examples 5 and 6 in which the electrode wound body was formed in an inert gas atmosphere and a dry air atmosphere, respectively, the discharging capacity retention ratio at the 100 th  cycle is significantly improved as compared with the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery in Comparative Example 5 in which the electrode wound body was formed in atmospheric air.

These portable electronic devices have come to be further required to be reduced in size and weight, and to meet such a requirement, studies have been actively made to enhance the energy density of batteries, particularly, secondary batteries used as portable power sources of these portable electronic devices. In particular, lithium ion secondary batteries capable of acquiring a large energy density as compared with conventional non-aqueous electrolyte batteries such as a lead battery and a nickel-cadmium battery have been increasingly expected to be useful as the above portable power sources. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0003\" num=\"0003\">[0003] By the way, a carbon material such as difficult-graphitization carbon or graphite has been widely used as a negative electrode material used for lithium ion secondary batteries. This is because such a carbon material exhibits a relatively high charging/discharging capacity and realizes a good cycle characteristic. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] Along with the recent tendency toward higher charging/discharging capacity, however, the above-described carbon material has become insufficient in charging/discharging capacity, and therefore, it has been required to develop a negative electrode material having a further improved performance. For example, studies have been made to develop a non-carbon (typically, silicon or tin) based negative electrode material having a higher charging/discharging capacity in place of the above-described carbon material, and further, studies have been made to develop a negative electrode material using a mixture of such a non-carbon material and a carbon material, a negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] The above-described negative electrode material, negative electrode using the negative electrode material, and non-aqueous electrolyte battery using the negative electrode, however, have a problem that since powders of a non-carbon material and a carbon material used as the negative electrode material absorb moisture in atmospheric air during the production process, there may occur degradation of the quality and a danger of dust explosion

Referring to FIG. 1, a non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> is produced by closely stacking a film-like positive electrode <b>2</b> and a film-like negative electrode <b>3</b> with a separator <b>4</b> put therebetween and winding the stack to form a wound body, putting the wound body in a battery container <b>5</b>, and pouring a non-aqueous electrolytic solution used as an electrolyte in the battery container <b>5</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0023\" num=\"0023\">[0023] The positive electrode <b>2</b> is produced by applying a positive electrode black mix containing a positive active material and a binder on a positive electrode collector, and drying the positive electrode black mix, to form a positive active material layer on the positive electrode collector. A metal foil, typically, an aluminum foil is used as the positive electrode collector. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0024\" num=\"0024\">[0024] The positive active material may be selected from metal oxides, metal sulfides, and specific polymers depending on the kind of battery to be produced. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0025\" num=\"0025\">[0025] For example, the positive active material used for lithium primary batteries may be selected from TiS<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, graphite, and FeS<sub>2</sub>, and the positive active material used for lithium secondary batteries may be selected from metal sulfides and metal oxides such as TiS<sub>2</sub>, MOS<sub>2</sub>, NbSe<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0026\" num=\"0026\">[0026] Further, as the positive active material used for lithium secondary batteries, there may be used a lithium composite oxide expressed by a chemical formula Li<sub>x</sub>MO<sub>2 </sub>where M is one kind or more transition metals, and x is a value depending on a charging/discharging state and is generally in a range of 0.05\u2266x\u22661.10. The transition metal M contained in the lithium composite oxide is preferably selected from Co, Ni, and Mn. Specific examples of the lithium composite oxides may include LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, Li<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>CO<sub>1\u2212y</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(x and y are values depending on the charging/discharging state of the battery, generally, 0&lt;x&lt;1 and 0.7&lt;y&lt;1.02), and LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0027\" num=\"0027\">[0027] The above-described lithium composite oxide is capable of generating a high voltage, and therefore, it becomes a positive active material excellent in terms of energy density. A plurality of these positive active materials may be used in combination for the positive electrode <b>2</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0028\" num=\"0028\">[0028] The binder contained in the above-described positive electrode black mix may be a known binder generally used for a positive electrode black mix of a battery of this type, and a known additive may be added to the positive electrode black mix. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0029\" num=\"0029\">[0029] The negative electrode <b>3</b> is produced by applying a negative electrode black mix containing a negative active material and a binder on a negative electrode collector, and drying the negative electrode black mix, to form a negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector. A metal foil, typically, a copper foil is used as the negative electrode collector. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0030\" num=\"0030\">[0030] In the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, a mixture of a non-carbon material and a carbon material is used as the negative active material. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0031\" num=\"0031\">[0031] As the non-carbon material, there may be used a material forming, together with lithium, an alloy expressed by a chemical formula Li<sub>x</sub>MM\u2032 where M and M\u2032 are elements other than Li and C, and x is in a range of x\u22670.01. Specific examples of the non-carbon materials may include a silicon compound, a tin compound, an indium compound, and an aluminum compound. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0032\" num=\"0032\">[0032] If one of M and M\u2032 is an element (such as silicon, tin, indium or aluminum) forming, together with lithium, an alloy expressed by a chemical formula Li<sub>x</sub>M or Li<sub>x</sub>M\u2032 (M and M\u2032 are elements other than Li and C, and x is in a range of x\u22670.01) then the other one of M and M\u2032 may be a non-carbon element being inactive with lithium. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0033\" num=\"0033\">[0033] The value x in the above chemical formula specified to be in the range of x\u22670.01 as described above is preferably in a range of x\u22670.1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0034\" num=\"0034\">[0034] As the silicon compound, there may be used a compound expressed by a chemical formula M<sub>x</sub>Si where M is an element other than Li and Si, for example, B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Y, Mo, Rh, Pd, In, Sn, Cs, Ba, Ce, or Ta. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0035\" num=\"0035\">[0035] As the carbon material, there may be widely used a difficult-graphitization carbon material having a spacing between (002) planes in a range of 0.37 nm or more, a graphite based carbon material having a spacing between the (002) planes in a range of 0.340 nm or less, or an easy-graphitization carbon material. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0036\" num=\"0036\">[0036] Specific examples of the carbon materials may include pyrolytic carbons, cokes such as pitch coke, needle coke, petroleum coke, graphites, vitreous carbons, baked bodies of organic high polymer compounds, carbon fibers, and activated charcoals. Additionally, the above baked body of an organic high polymer compound is typically produced by baking phenol resin or furan resin at a suitable temperature so as to carbonize the resin. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0037\" num=\"0037\">[0037] The above-described carbon materials may be used singly or in combination. In particular, it may be desirable to use at least the difficult-graphitization carbon material, to which the easy-graphitization carbon material or graphite based carbon material may be added at a suitable mixing ratio. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0038\" num=\"0038\">[0038] In the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b>, a ratio of an average particle size R<sub>M </sub>of the non-carbon material in the negative active material to an average particle size R<sub>C </sub>of the carbon material in the negative active material is specified in a range of R<sub>M</sub>/R<sub>C</sub>\u22661. That is to say, the average particle size of the non-carbon material in the negative active material is made smaller than the average particle size of the carbon material in the negative active material. As a result, particles of the non-carbon material permeate gaps formed by particles of the carbon material having larger particle sizes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0039\" num=\"0039\">[0039] To be more specific, according to the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> in this embodiment, in the negative electrode containing the non-carbon material and the carbon material, the gaps formed by particles of the carbon material having larger particle sizes are used as fields where lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material. Since lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material in the gaps formed by the particles of the carbon material, if there occurs a change in volume of the non-carbon material due to expansion or contraction of the non-carbon material when lithium is doped or released in or from the non-carbon material, then the change in volume of the non-carbon material can be absorbed by the gaps formed by the particles of the carbon material. As a result, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the entire negative active material, and hence to significantly improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0040\" num=\"0040\">[0040] If the ratio R<sub>M</sub>/R<sub>C </sub>is larger than 1, that is, the average particle size of the non-carbon material is larger than the average particle size of the carbon material, then a change in volume of the non-carbon material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material cannot be absorbed by the carbon material. As described above, by specifying the ratio R<sub>M</sub>/R<sub>C </sub>in the range of 1 or less, it is possible to suppress a change in volume of the negative active material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the non-carbon material, and hence to improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0041\" num=\"0041\">[0041] The average particle size R<sub>C </sub>of the carbon material contained in the negative active material is preferably in a range of about 10 \u03bcm to 70 \u03bcm. The shape of the carbon material is not particularly limited but may be selected from various shapes such as a granular shape and a flake shape. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0042\" num=\"0042\">[0042] The average particle size R<sub>M </sub>of the non-carbon material contained in the negative active material is preferably in a range of about 20 \u03bcm or less, more preferably, in a range of about 10 \u03bcm or less. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0043\" num=\"0043\">[0043] The particle sizes and the average particle size of each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material will be described below. In this embodiment, the method of measuring the particle sizes and the average particle size of each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material is not particularly limited but may be any one of various known methods of measuring the sizes of particles having irregular shapes insofar as the ratio R<sub>M</sub>/R<sub>C </sub>is in the range of 1 or less. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0044\" num=\"0044\">[0044] For example, as the method of measuring the particle sizes, there may be adopted a method of sieving particles and determining the size of the particles on the base of the mesh of a sieve through which the particles do not pass, or a method of settling particles in a liquid, measuring the settling rate of the particles, and determining the size (Stokes&#39; diameters) of the particles by using the Stokes&#39; equation. In addition, the Stokes&#39; diameter indicates a diameter of a spherical particle which has the same density as that of a sample particle and which is settled at the same setting rate as that of the sample particle under the same condition. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0045\" num=\"0045\">[0045] By the way, powders generally have a distribution of particles sizes, and if such powders having a distribution of particles sizes are regarded to be substantially the same as powders having uniform particle sizes R in term of an effect exerted on a certain phenomenon, then it is convenient to use the particle size R of the powders as the typical particle size thereof. The particle size R of powders is called an average particle size thereof. Accordingly, the determination of the average particle size of powders differs depending on the purpose of the powders. For example, the average particle size of powders may be determined, but not limited thereto, on the basis of an equation of \u03a3nR/\u03a3n where R is the particle size of each particle and n is the number of particles. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0046\" num=\"0046\">[0046] With respect to the mixture of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, a ratio of a weight W<sub>M </sub>of the non-carbon material to a weight W<sub>C </sub>of the carbon material is preferably in a range of W<sub>M</sub>/W<sub>C</sub>\u22661. The reason for this is as follows: namely, in the case where the existing ratio of the non-carbon material is more than 50%, even if there appears a change in volume of the non-carbon material due to expansion or contraction thereof caused by doping or release in or from the non-carbon material, then there is a possibility that the change in volume of the non-carbon material cannot be absorbed by the gaps of particles of the carbon material and thereby a change in volume of the entire negative active material cannot be suppressed. As a result, it fails to improve the cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0047\" num=\"0047\">[0047] The non-aqueous electrolytic solution is prepared by dissolving an electrolyte in a non-aqueous solvent. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0048\" num=\"0048\">[0048] The electrolyte may be a known electrolyte generally used for a battery of this type. Specific examples of the electrolytes may include lithium salts such as LiClO<sub>4</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiB(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Li, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Li, LiCl, and LiBr. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0049\" num=\"0049\">[0049] The non-aqueous solvent may be a known non-aqueous solvent generally used for a non-aqueous electrolytic solution. Specific examples of the non-aqueous solvents may include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, 1,2-dimethoxy ethane, 1,2-diethoxy ethane, \u03b3-butyrolactone, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxosilane, 4-methy-1,3-dioxosilane, diethyl ether, sulfolane, methyl sulfolane, acetonitrile, propionitrile, anisole, acetic ester, butyric ester, and propionic ester. These non-aqueous solvents may be used singly or in combination. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0050\" num=\"0050\">[0050] The cycle characteristic of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> is significantly improved by specifying a ratio in particle size between the silicon compound and the carbon material contained in the negative electrode, thereby suppressing a change in volume of the negative active material caused by doping or release of lithium in or from the silicon compound. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0051\" num=\"0051\">[0051] A method of producing the above-described non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> will be described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0052\" num=\"0052\">[0052] The positive electrode <b>2</b> is produced by uniformly applying a positive electrode black mix containing a positive active material and a binder on a metal foil typically an aluminum foil as a positive electrode collector and drying the positive electrode black mix, to form a positive active material layer on a positive electrode collector. The binder of the positive electrode black mix may be a known binder, and a known additive may be added to the positive electrode black mix. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0053\" num=\"0053\">[0053] The negative electrode <b>3</b> is provided by pulverizing and classifying each of a non-carbon material and a carbon material to prepare a powder of the non-carbon material and a powder of the carbon material, mixing these powders with each other to produce a negative electrode material composed of the mixture of the non-carbon material and the carbon material, mixing a binder with the negative electrode material to produce a negative electrode black mix, uniformly applying the negative electrode black mix on a metal foil typically an aluminum foil as a negative electrode collector and drying the negative electrode black mix to form a negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector, and compressing the negative active material layer on the negative electrode collector by hot-pressing. The binder of the negative electrode black mix may be a known binder, and a known additive may be added to the negative electrode black mix. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0054\" num=\"0054\">[0054] The step of pulverizing and classifying each of the carbon material and the non-carbon material is performed in an inert gas atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent occurrence of accidents such as dust explosion and firing, and hence to safely perform the pulverizing/classifying work. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0055\" num=\"0055\">[0055] The step of mixing the carbon material and the non-carbon material with each other is performed in an inert gas atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent occurrence of accidents such as dust explosion and firing, and hence to safely perform the mixing work. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0056\" num=\"0056\">[0056] The step of applying the negative electrode black mix on the metal foil and drying the negative electrode black mix is performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. As a result, it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode <b>3</b> from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode black mix and hence to produce the negative electrode <b>3</b> with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> with a high quality. It should be noted that the dry air atmosphere means a state in which a dew point is \u221210\u00b0 C. or less. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0057\" num=\"0057\">[0057] The above-described hot-pressing is performed at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. or more. Since the negative electrode black mix is compressed by hot-pressing to produce the negative electrode <b>3</b>, it is possible to prevent the quality of the negative electrode <b>3</b> from being degraded due to absorption of moisture in atmospheric air to the negative electrode black mix and to uniformly bond the non-carbon material layer and the carbon material layer to each other. Accordingly, by compressing the negative electrode black mix by hot-pressing, it is possible to produce the negative electrode <b>3</b> with a high quality and also the non-aqueous electrolyte battery <b>1</b> with a high quality. The hot-pressing is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or a dry air atmosphere. This makes it possible to further enhance the above-described hot-pressing effect.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION  \\n     [0001] The benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/181,730, filed Feb. 11, 2000, is claimed. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0002] The invention relates generally to vehicle seat belt assemblies of the type having a lap belt and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap. The invention more particularly relates to shoulder strap repositioners, which may also be referred to as \u201cadjusters,\u201d for repositioning or deflecting the diagonally-extending shoulder strap component of vehicle seat belt assemblies.  \\n       [0003] Conventional seat belt assemblies, which include a lap belt and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap, are designed primarily for use by adults of average size. When used by an adult, the shoulder strap extends generally across the chest and shoulder of the individual.  \\n       [0004] However, when the seat belt assembly is used by a child or smaller adult, the shoulder strap typically extends across the neck or face of the child because his or her upper body is not quite as long as that of a taller individual.  \\n       [0005] A variety of shoulder strap repositioners or \u201cadjusters,\u201d particularly for use by children, have been proposed, and several have been commercially produced. Particularly relevant in the context of the subject invention are the devices disclosed in Shreier et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,078; Blake U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,446 and Campbell U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,099.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006] In an exemplary embodiment, a shoulder strap repositioner takes the form of a body positionable against the torso of a seated person. The body includes a central portion having a rear surface that faces the torso during use, and an opposed front surface. The body additionally includes left and right side wings each having a rear surface that faces the torso during use, and an opposed front surface. Each of the side wings includes upper and lower base portions attached to the central portion. An upper finger extends from an upper finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper finger distal end, a lower finger extending from a lower finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower finger distal end. A gap is defined between the upper and lower finger distal ends. The upper and lower fingers, in cooperation with the central portion, together define generally vertically extending left and right side slots accessed via the gaps. The slots and gaps are configured such that, for use, the lap belt and shoulder strap are inserted through the gaps, and such that, during use, the shoulder strap passes through the slots and the lap belt at least engages the lower fingers, with the lap belt and shoulder strap crossing over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings and crossing over portions of the rear surface of the central portion.  \\n       [0007] In another exemplary embodiment a shoulder strap repositioner comprises a body positionable against the torso of a seated person. The body also includes a central portion and left and right side wings. Each of the side wings includes upper and lower base portions attached to the central portion. An upper relatively inner finger extends from an upper relatively inner finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger distal end, and a lower relatively inner finger extends from a lower relatively inner finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger distal end. A relatively inner gap is defined between the upper and lower relatively inner finger distal ends. The upper and lower relatively inner fingers, in cooperation with the central portion, together define generally vertically extending relatively inner left and right side slots accessed via the relatively inner gaps. In addition, an upper relatively outer finger extends from an upper relatively outer finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger distal end, and a lower relatively outer finger extends from a lower relatively outer finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower relatively outer finger distal end. A relatively outer gap is defined between the upper and lower relatively outer finger distal ends. The upper and lower relatively outer fingers, in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers, together define generally vertically extending relatively outer left and right side slots accessed via the relatively outer gaps. The slots and gaps are configured such that, for use, the shoulder strap is inserted through the relatively inner gaps and the lap belt is inserted through the relatively outer gaps and such that, during use, the shoulder belt passes through the relatively inner slots and the lap belt at least engages the lower relatively outer fingers, with the lap belt and shoulder strap crossing over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings and crossing over portions of the rear surface of the central portion.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0008]FIG. 1 depicts a shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention in use;  \\n     [0009]FIG. 2 is an enlarged front elevational view of the respositioner of FIG. 1;  \\n     [0010]FIG. 3 is a side elevational view taken on line  3 - 3  of FIG. 2;  \\n     [0011]FIG. 4 is a cross-section taken on line  4 - 4  of FIG. 2;  \\n     [0012]FIG. 5 is a cross-section taken on line  5 - 5  of FIG. 2;  \\n     [0013]FIG. 6 schematically depicts the manner in which the repositioner is attached to the shoulder strap;  \\n     [0014]FIG. 7 schematically depicts the manner in which the repositioner is subsequently attached to the lap belt;  \\n     [0015]FIG. 8 is an enlarged view depicting the repositioner in use;  \\n     [0016]FIG. 9 is a front elevational view of another shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention;  \\n     [0017]FIG. 10 is a front elevational view of yet another shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention;  \\n     [0018]FIG. 11 is a side elevational view taken on line  11 - 11  of FIG. 10; and  \\n     [0019]FIG. 12 is a rear elevational view thereof. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION  \\n     [0020] Referring first to FIG. 1, a child  20  or an adult of short stature is seated in a vehicle seat  22  equipped with a conventional seat belt assembly, generally designated  24 . The seat belt assembly  24  includes a lap belt  26  and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28  attached to one element  30  of a buckle device  32 . A shoulder strap repositioner  34  embodying the invention is positioned against the torso of the child  20 , or other seated person. In the absence of deflection provided by the repositioner  34 , the shoulder strap  28  undesirably would tend to cross the face  38  or neck  40  of the child  20 .  \\n     [0021] Referring now additionally to FIGS.  2 - 5 , the repositioner  34  comprises a body  50 , molded in one piece of a plastic such as LLDPE, or some other material which has a suitable combination of stiffness and flexibility to function as described hereinbelow. The repositioner  34  is symmetrical about a vertical center line, so that it can be used with right-hand or left-hand vehicle seat belt assemblies  24 .  \\n     [0022] The repositioner body  50  has a central portion  52  which is generally convex when viewed from the front as in FIG. 2, with a central ornamental feature  54 . The ornamental feature  54  takes the form of a concave recess when viewed from the front. When viewed from the rear, and as may be seen in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 4 and 5, the central portion  52  in general is concave, while the ornamental feature  54  is convex. The central portion  52  has a rear surface  56  that faces the torso  36  during use, and an opposed front surface  58 . As may be seen in the side elevational view of FIG. 3 and in the cross-section of FIG. 4, the body  50  of the repositioner  34  is curved to accommodate the pelvic contour of the user.  \\n     [0023] Integrally attached to the central portion  52  are a left side wing  60  and a right side wing  62 . The left side wing  60  in turn includes an upper base portion  64  and a lower base portion  66 . Correspondingly, the right side wing  62  in turn includes an upper base portion  68  and a lower base portion  70 .  \\n     [0024] On the left side, an upper relatively inner finger  72  extends from an upper relatively inner finger  72  proximal end  74  attached to the upper base portion  64  downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger  72  distal end  76 . Correspondingly, on the right side, an upper relatively inner finger  78  extends from an upper relatively inner finger  78  proximal end  80  attached to the upper base portion  68  downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger  78  distal end  82 .  \\n     [0025] Again on the left side, a lower relatively inner finger  92  extends from a lower relatively inner finger  92  proximal end  94  attached to the lower base portion  66  of the left side wing  60  upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger  92  distal end  96 . The left side upper and lower relatively inner fingers  72  and  92  thus define a left side inner finger pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a lower relatively inner finger  98  extends from a lower relatively inner finger  98  proximal end  100  attached to the lower base portion  70  of the right side wing  62  upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger  98  distal end  102 . The right side upper and lower relatively inner fingers  78  and  98  thus define a right side inner finger pair.  \\n     [0026] A left side relatively inner gap  104  is defined between the distal ends  76  and  96  of the left side inner finger pair  72 ,  92 . A right side relatively inner gap  106  is defined between the distal ends  82  and  102  of the right side inner finger pair  78 ,  98 .  \\n     [0027] The left side upper relatively inner finger  72  and the left side lower relatively inner finger  92 , in cooperation with the central portion  52 , together define a generally vertically extending relatively inner left side slot  108 , accessed via the left side relatively inner gap  104 . Correspondingly, the right side upper relatively inner finger  78  and the right side lower relatively inner finger  98 , in cooperation with the central portion  52 , together define a generally vertically extending relatively inner right side slot  110 , accessed via the right side relatively inner gap  106 .  \\n     [0028] In addition to the relatively inner left and right side finger pairs  72 ,  92  and  78 ,  98 , there are pairs of relatively outer flexible fingers.  \\n     [0029] Thus, on the left side an upper relatively outer finger  112  extends from an upper relatively outer finger  112  proximal end  114  attached to the upper base portion  64  of the left side wing  60  downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger  112  distal end  116 . Correspondingly, on the right side an upper relatively outer finger  118  extends from an upper relatively outer finger  118  proximal end  120  attached to the upper base portion  68  of the right side wing  62  downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger  118  distal end  122 .  \\n     [0030] Again on the left side, a lower relatively outer finger  132  extends from a lower relatively outer finger  132  proximal end  134  attached to the lower base portion  66  of the left side wing  60  upwardly to a lower relatively outer finger  132  distal end  136 . The left side upper and lower relatively outer fingers  112  and  132  thus define a left side outer finger pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a lower relatively inner finger  138  extends from a lower relatively inner finger  138  proximal end  140  attached to the lower base portion  70  of the right side wing  62  upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger  138  distal end  142 . The right side upper and lower relatively outer fingers  118  and  138  thus define a right side outer finger pair.  \\n     [0031] A left side relatively outer gap  144  is defined between the distal ends  116  and  136  of the left side outer finger pair  112 ,  132 . Similarly, a right side outer gap  146  is defined between the distal ends  122  and  142  of the right side upper and lower outer finger pair  118 ,  138 .  \\n     [0032] On the left side, the upper and lower relatively outer fingers  112  and  132 , in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers  72  and  92  together define a generally vertically extending relatively outer left side slot  148  accessed via the relatively outer gap  144 . Correspondingly, the right side upper and lower relatively outer fingers  118  and  138 , in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers  78  and  98 , define a generally vertically extending relatively outer right side slot  150 , accessed via the right side relatively outer gap  146 .  \\n     [0033] With reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and  8 , for installation and use, the user sits in the vehicle seat  22 , with the lap belt  26  and shoulder strap  28  in the correct position. With particular reference to FIG. 6, the fingers  72 ,  78 ,  92 ,  98 ,  112 ,  118 ,  132  and  138  are flexed as needed to position the shoulder strap  28  between the relatively inner finger pairs  72 ,  92  and  78 ,  98  and the central portion  52 , passing through the relatively inner left and right side slots  108  and  110 . Insertion of the shoulder strap  28  is made possible on the left side by the gaps  104  and  144  and, on the right side, by the gaps  106  and  146 .  \\n     [0034] Then, and with particular reference to FIG. 7, the relatively outer finger pairs  112 ,  132  and  118 ,  138  are flexed as needed, and the lap belt  26  is positioned between the outer finger pairs  112 ,  132  and the inner finger pairs  72 ,  92  and  78 ,  98 , passing through the relatively outer left and right side slots  148  and  150 . (In FIG. 7, for purposes of illustration, the shoulder strap  28  is not shown.) Insertion of the lap belt  26  is made possible by the relatively outer left and right side gaps  144  and  146 .  \\n     [0035] However, it is not necessary for the lap belt  26  to fully engage the relatively outer left and right side slots  148  and  150 . Thus, it is sufficient for the lap belt  26 , or at least the lower edge thereof, to engage only the lower relatively outer fingers  132  and  138 . Engagement with the upper relatively outer fingers  112  and  118  is not required. In any event, in the final installed configuration, the lap belt  26  and shoulder strap  28  cross over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings  60  and  62 , and cross over portions of the rear surface  56  of the central portion  52 .  \\n     [0036] The repositioner  34  is then slid to the left or right, as required, to allow the shoulder strap  28  to ride in the most comfortable position midway between the neck  40  and shoulder, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The grip provided by the finger pairs  72 ,  92 ;  78 ,  98 ;  112 ,  132  and  118 ,  138  and the central portion  52  allows the repositioner  34  to be held in place, while still allowing the user to move the repositioner  34  left or right along the lap belt  26  to provide a comfortable fit of the diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28  for the user. The grip is aided by a bead  152  along the edges of the slots  108 ,  110 ,  148  and  150 . The bead  152  actually extends continuously along all exposed edges of the body  50 , thus avoiding sharp edges.  \\n     [0037] The material has the correct combination of stiffness and flexibility to allow the finger pairs  72 ,  92 ;  78 ,  98 ;  112 ,  132  and  118 ,  138  to hold the repositioner  34  in place. In addition, the relatively outer finger pairs  112 ,  132  and  118 ,  138  flex in the event of an accident in order to allow the shoulder strap  28  to separate from the lap belt  26  and move to an optimum position of the diagonal shoulder strap  28  in order to protect the user in a manner consistent with the designed function of the vehicle seat belt assembly  24 . In the alternative attachment connection, wherein the lap belt  26  is engaged only by the lower relatively outer fingers  132  and  138 , the same result is achieved. In either event, the repositioner  34  remains attached to the diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28 , and so does not become a projectile in the event of an accident.  \\n     [0038] Further, to prevent distortion during use, the central portion. 52  is relatively rigid compared to the fingers  72 ,  78 ,  92 ,  98 ,  112 ,  118 ,  132  and  138 . The profile of the central portion  52 , as is perhaps best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 5, aids in maintaining rigidity.  \\n     [0039] With reference now to FIG. 9, depicted is another repositioner  160  embodiment, differing from the repositioner  34  of FIGS.  1 - 8  in that on each side there is only a single finger pair, and a single slot. In other respects, the FIG. 9 repositioner  160  is similar to the repositioner  34  of FIGS.  1 - 8 , and the side elevational view of FIG. 3, as well as the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 4 and 5 are applicable.  \\n     [0040] Like the repositioner  34 , the repositioner  160  of FIG. 9 comprises a body  162 , also molded in one piece of a plastic such as LLDPE, or some other material which has a suitable combination of stiffness and flexibility to function as described herein. The repositioner  160  is symmetrical about a vertical center line, so that it can be used with right-hand or left-hand vehicle seat belt assemblies  24 .  \\n     [0041] The repositioner body  162  has a central portion  164  which is generally convex when viewed from the front as in FIG. 9, with a central ornamental feature  166 . The ornamental feature  166  takes the form of a concave recess when viewed from the front. The central portion  164  has a rear surface that faces the torso  36  during use (like the rear surface  56 ), and an opposed front surface  168 . The body  162  of the repositioner  160  is curved to accommodate the pelvic contour of the user.  \\n     [0042] Integrally attached to the central portion  164  are a left side wing  170  and a right side wing  172 . The left side wing  170  in turn includes an upper base portion  174  and a lower base portion  176 . Correspondingly, the right side wing  172  in turn includes an upper base portion  178  and a lower base portion  180 .  \\n     [0043] On the left side, a single upper finger  182  extends from an upper finger  182  proximal end  184  attached to the upper base portion  174  downwardly to an upper finger  182  distal end  186 . Correspondingly, on the right side, a single upper finger  188  extends from an upper finger  188  proximal end  190  attached to the upper base portion  178  downwardly to an upper finger  188  distal end  192 .  \\n     [0044] Again on the left side, a single lower finger  202  extends from a lower finger  202  proximal end  204  attached to the lower base portion  176  of the left side wing  170  upwardly to a lower finger  202  distal end  206 . The left side upper and lower fingers  182  and  202  thus define a left side pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a single lower finger  208  extends from a lower relatively inner finger  208  proximal end  210  attached to the lower base portion  180  of the right side wing  172  upwardly to a lower finger  208  distal end  212 . The right side upper and lower fingers  188  and  208  thus define a right side finger pair.  \\n     [0045] The fingers  182 ,  188 ,  202  and  208  are more than twice as wide as the individual fingers of the repositioner  34 , and in effect are evolved from the embodiment of FIGS.  2 - 8  by the addition of connecting webs  214 ,  216 ,  218  and  220 . Openings  222 ,  224 ,  226  and  228  defined as a result are non-functional, and ornamental in nature.  \\n     [0046] A left side gap  236  is defined between the distal ends  186  and  206  of the left side finger pair  182 ,  202 . A right side gap  238  is defined between the distal ends  192  and  212  of the right side finger pair  188 ,  208 .  \\n     [0047] The left side upper finger  182  and the left side lower finger  202 , in cooperation with the central portion  164 , together define a single generally vertically extending left side slot  240 , accessed via the left side gap  236 . Correspondingly, the right side upper finger  188  and the right side lower finger  208 , in cooperation with the central portion  164 , together define a single generally vertically extending right side slot  242 , accessed via the right side gap  238 .  \\n     [0048] For installation and use, the user sits in the vehicle seat  22 , with the lap belt  26  and shoulder strap  28  in the correct position. The fingers  182 ,  188 ,  202  and  208  are flexed as needed to position the shoulder strap  28  between the finger pairs  182 ,  202  and  188 ,  208  and the central portion  164 , passing through the left and right side slots  240  and  242 . Insertion of the shoulder strap  28  is made possible on the left side by the gap  236  and, on the right side, by the gap  238 .  \\n     [0049] Then, the same fingers  182 ,  188 ,  202  and  208  are again flexed as needed, and the lap belt  26  is positioned so as to pass through the same slots  240  and  242 . Insertion of the lap belt  26  is likewise made possible by the left and right side gaps  236  and  238 .  \\n     [0050] However, it is not necessary for the lap belt  26  to fully engage the left and right side slots  236  and  238 . Thus, it is sufficient for the lap belt  26 , or at least the lower edge thereof, to engage only the lower fingers  202  and  208 . Engagement with the upper fingers  182  and  188  is not required. In any event, in the final installed configuration, the lap belt  26  and shoulder strap  28  cross over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings  170  and  172 , and cross over portions of the rear surface of the central portion  164 .  \\n     [0051] As in the case of the repositioner  34 , the repositioner  160  is then slid to the left or right, as required, to allow the shoulder strap  28  to ride in the most comfortable position midway between the neck  40  and shoulder, in the same manner as is illustrated in FIG. 1. The grip provided by the finger pairs  182 ,  202  and  188 ,  208 , and the central portion  164 , allows the repositioner  160  to be held in place, while still allowing the user to move the repositioner  160  left or right along the lap belt  26  to provide a comfortable fit of the diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28  for the user. The grip is aided by a bead  244  along the edges of the slots  240  and  242 .  \\n     [0052] The bead  244  actually extends continuously along all exposed edges of the body  162 , thus avoiding sharp edges. In addition, the edges of the ornamental openings  222 ,  224 ,  226  and  228  have individual continuous beads  246 ,  248 ,  250  and  252 , respectively, along their edges.  \\n     [0053] The repositioner  160  of FIG. 9 functions generally in the same manner as the repositioner  34  of FIGS.  2 - 8 . Having the lap belt  26  and the diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28  pass through the same pair of slots  240  (on the left side) and  242  (on the right side) is similar in result. The finger pairs  182 ,  202  and  188 ,  208  flex in the event of an accident in order to allow the shoulder strap  28  to separate from the lap belt  26  and move to an optimum position of the diagonal shoulder strap  28  in order to protect the user in a manner consistent with the designed function of the vehicle seat belt assembly  24 . In the alternative attachment connection, wherein the lap belt  26  is engaged only by the lower fingers  202  and  208 , the same result is achieved. In either event, the repositioner  160  remains attached to the diagonally-extending shoulder strap  28 , and so does not become a projectile in the event of an accident.  \\n     [0054] Likewise, to prevent distortion during use, the central portion  164  is relatively rigid compared to the fingers  182 ,  188 ,  202  and  206 . The profile of the central portion  164  (which is substantially identical to the profile of the central portion  52  of the repositioner  34  embodiment, as perhaps best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 5), aids in maintaining rigidity.  \\n     [0055] It may be noted that the repositioner  34  of FIGS.  2 - 8  is capable of being installed in the same manner as the repositioner  160  of FIG. 9, by ignoring the relatively outer left and right side slots  148  and  150 , and employing only the relatively inner left and right side slots  108  and  110  in the same manner as the single left and right side slots  240  and  242  of the repositioner  160  embodiment of FIG. 9.  \\n     [0056] Referring finally to FIGS.  10 - 12 , depicted is a third repositioner  260  embodiment, which differs from the repositioner  160  of FIG. 9 in that a foam backing  262  is included, for added user comfort. As is best seen in the rear elevational view of FIG. 12, the foam backing  262  is cut out to conform to the left and right side slots  240  and  242 , as well as the left and right side gaps  236  and  238  that provide access.  \\n     [0057] In all other respects, the repositioner  260  of FIGS.  10 - 12  is substantially identical to the repositioner  160  of FIG. 9, and identical reference numerals are accordingly employed as a matter of convenience.  \\n     [0058] As seen in the rear elevational view of FIG. 12, the foam backing  262  is cut so as to be positioned just inside the bead  244  along the outer edge of the body  162 , and along the edges of the left and right side gaps  236  and  238  and the left and right side slots  240  and  242 . However, in the illustrated embodiment, the foam backing  262  extends entirely across the ornamental openings  222 ,  224 ,  226  and  228 . The foam backing  262  is thus partially visible in the front elevational view of FIG. 10.  \\n     [0059] The repositioner  260  of FIGS.  10 - 12  is installed and functions in the same manner as the repositioner  160  of FIG. 9. Accordingly, the descriptions of that installation and operation are not repeated.  \\n     [0060] While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is realized that numerous modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

No. 60/181,730, filed Feb. 11, 2000, is claimed.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <summary-of-invention>\\n      <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0002\" num=\"0002\">[0002] The invention relates generally to vehicle seat belt assemblies of the type having a lap belt and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap. The invention more particularly relates to shoulder strap repositioners, which may also be referred to as \u201cadjusters,\u201d for repositioning or deflecting the diagonally-extending shoulder strap component of vehicle seat belt assemblies. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0003\" num=\"0003\">[0003] Conventional seat belt assemblies, which include a lap belt and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap, are designed primarily for use by adults of average size. When used by an adult, the shoulder strap extends generally across the chest and shoulder of the individual. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] However, when the seat belt assembly is used by a child or smaller adult, the shoulder strap typically extends across the neck or face of the child because his or her upper body is not quite as long as that of a taller individual. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] A variety of shoulder strap repositioners or \u201cadjusters,\u201d particularly for use by children, have been proposed, and several have been commercially produced. Particularly relevant in the context of the subject invention are the devices disclosed in Shreier et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,078; Blake U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,446 and Campbell U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,099. </p>\\n      <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] In an exemplary embodiment, a shoulder strap repositioner takes the form of a body positionable against the torso of a seated person. The body includes a central portion having a rear surface that faces the torso during use, and an opposed front surface. The body additionally includes left and right side wings each having a rear surface that faces the torso during use, and an opposed front surface. Each of the side wings includes upper and lower base portions attached to the central portion. An upper finger extends from an upper finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper finger distal end, a lower finger extending from a lower finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower finger distal end. A gap is defined between the upper and lower finger distal ends. The upper and lower fingers, in cooperation with the central portion, together define generally vertically extending left and right side slots accessed via the gaps. The slots and gaps are configured such that, for use, the lap belt and shoulder strap are inserted through the gaps, and such that, during use, the shoulder strap passes through the slots and the lap belt at least engages the lower fingers, with the lap belt and shoulder strap crossing over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings and crossing over portions of the rear surface of the central portion. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] In another exemplary embodiment a shoulder strap repositioner comprises a body positionable against the torso of a seated person. The body also includes a central portion and left and right side wings. Each of the side wings includes upper and lower base portions attached to the central portion. An upper relatively inner finger extends from an upper relatively inner finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger distal end, and a lower relatively inner finger extends from a lower relatively inner finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger distal end. A relatively inner gap is defined between the upper and lower relatively inner finger distal ends. The upper and lower relatively inner fingers, in cooperation with the central portion, together define generally vertically extending relatively inner left and right side slots accessed via the relatively inner gaps. In addition, an upper relatively outer finger extends from an upper relatively outer finger proximal end attached to the upper base portion downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger distal end, and a lower relatively outer finger extends from a lower relatively outer finger proximal end attached to the lower base portion upwardly to a lower relatively outer finger distal end. A relatively outer gap is defined between the upper and lower relatively outer finger distal ends. The upper and lower relatively outer fingers, in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers, together define generally vertically extending relatively outer left and right side slots accessed via the relatively outer gaps. The slots and gaps are configured such that, for use, the shoulder strap is inserted through the relatively inner gaps and the lap belt is inserted through the relatively outer gaps and such that, during use, the shoulder belt passes through the relatively inner slots and the lap belt at least engages the lower relatively outer fingers, with the lap belt and shoulder strap crossing over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings and crossing over portions of the rear surface of the central portion. </p>\\n    </summary-of-invention>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>\\n    <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008]FIG. 1 depicts a shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention in use; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009]FIG. 2 is an enlarged front elevational view of the respositioner of FIG. 1; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010]FIG. 3 is a side elevational view taken on line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of FIG. 2; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011]FIG. 4 is a cross-section taken on line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of FIG. 2; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012]FIG. 5 is a cross-section taken on line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of FIG. 2; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013]FIG. 6 schematically depicts the manner in which the repositioner is attached to the shoulder strap; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0014\" num=\"0014\">[0014]FIG. 7 schematically depicts the manner in which the repositioner is subsequently attached to the lap belt; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0015\" num=\"0015\">[0015]FIG. 8 is an enlarged view depicting the repositioner in use; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0016\" num=\"0016\">[0016]FIG. 9 is a front elevational view of another shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0017\" num=\"0017\">[0017]FIG. 10 is a front elevational view of yet another shoulder strap repositioner embodying the invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0018\" num=\"0018\">[0018]FIG. 11 is a side elevational view taken on line <b>11</b>-<b>11</b> of FIG. 10; and </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0019\" num=\"0019\">[0019]FIG. 12 is a rear elevational view thereof.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>\\n    <p id=\"P-0020\" num=\"0020\">[0020] Referring first to FIG. 1, a child <b>20</b> or an adult of short stature is seated in a vehicle seat <b>22</b> equipped with a conventional seat belt assembly, generally designated <b>24</b>. The seat belt assembly <b>24</b> includes a lap belt <b>26</b> and a diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b> attached to one element <b>30</b> of a buckle device <b>32</b>. A shoulder strap repositioner <b>34</b> embodying the invention is positioned against the torso of the child <b>20</b>, or other seated person. In the absence of deflection provided by the repositioner <b>34</b>, the shoulder strap <b>28</b> undesirably would tend to cross the face <b>38</b> or neck <b>40</b> of the child <b>20</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0021\" num=\"0021\">[0021] Referring now additionally to FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>, the repositioner <b>34</b> comprises a body <b>50</b>, molded in one piece of a plastic such as LLDPE, or some other material which has a suitable combination of stiffness and flexibility to function as described hereinbelow. The repositioner <b>34</b> is symmetrical about a vertical center line, so that it can be used with right-hand or left-hand vehicle seat belt assemblies <b>24</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0022\" num=\"0022\">[0022] The repositioner body <b>50</b> has a central portion <b>52</b> which is generally convex when viewed from the front as in FIG. 2, with a central ornamental feature <b>54</b>. The ornamental feature <b>54</b> takes the form of a concave recess when viewed from the front. When viewed from the rear, and as may be seen in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 4 and 5, the central portion <b>52</b> in general is concave, while the ornamental feature <b>54</b> is convex. The central portion <b>52</b> has a rear surface <b>56</b> that faces the torso <b>36</b> during use, and an opposed front surface <b>58</b>. As may be seen in the side elevational view of FIG. 3 and in the cross-section of FIG. 4, the body <b>50</b> of the repositioner <b>34</b> is curved to accommodate the pelvic contour of the user. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0023\" num=\"0023\">[0023] Integrally attached to the central portion <b>52</b> are a left side wing <b>60</b> and a right side wing <b>62</b>. The left side wing <b>60</b> in turn includes an upper base portion <b>64</b> and a lower base portion <b>66</b>. Correspondingly, the right side wing <b>62</b> in turn includes an upper base portion <b>68</b> and a lower base portion <b>70</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0024\" num=\"0024\">[0024] On the left side, an upper relatively inner finger <b>72</b> extends from an upper relatively inner finger <b>72</b> proximal end <b>74</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>64</b> downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger <b>72</b> distal end <b>76</b>. Correspondingly, on the right side, an upper relatively inner finger <b>78</b> extends from an upper relatively inner finger <b>78</b> proximal end <b>80</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>68</b> downwardly to an upper relatively inner finger <b>78</b> distal end <b>82</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0025\" num=\"0025\">[0025] Again on the left side, a lower relatively inner finger <b>92</b> extends from a lower relatively inner finger <b>92</b> proximal end <b>94</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>66</b> of the left side wing <b>60</b> upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger <b>92</b> distal end <b>96</b>. The left side upper and lower relatively inner fingers <b>72</b> and <b>92</b> thus define a left side inner finger pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a lower relatively inner finger <b>98</b> extends from a lower relatively inner finger <b>98</b> proximal end <b>100</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>70</b> of the right side wing <b>62</b> upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger <b>98</b> distal end <b>102</b>. The right side upper and lower relatively inner fingers <b>78</b> and <b>98</b> thus define a right side inner finger pair. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0026\" num=\"0026\">[0026] A left side relatively inner gap <b>104</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>76</b> and <b>96</b> of the left side inner finger pair <b>72</b>, <b>92</b>. A right side relatively inner gap <b>106</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>82</b> and <b>102</b> of the right side inner finger pair <b>78</b>, <b>98</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0027\" num=\"0027\">[0027] The left side upper relatively inner finger <b>72</b> and the left side lower relatively inner finger <b>92</b>, in cooperation with the central portion <b>52</b>, together define a generally vertically extending relatively inner left side slot <b>108</b>, accessed via the left side relatively inner gap <b>104</b>. Correspondingly, the right side upper relatively inner finger <b>78</b> and the right side lower relatively inner finger <b>98</b>, in cooperation with the central portion <b>52</b>, together define a generally vertically extending relatively inner right side slot <b>110</b>, accessed via the right side relatively inner gap <b>106</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0028\" num=\"0028\">[0028] In addition to the relatively inner left and right side finger pairs <b>72</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>78</b>, <b>98</b>, there are pairs of relatively outer flexible fingers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0029\" num=\"0029\">[0029] Thus, on the left side an upper relatively outer finger <b>112</b> extends from an upper relatively outer finger <b>112</b> proximal end <b>114</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>64</b> of the left side wing <b>60</b> downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger <b>112</b> distal end <b>116</b>. Correspondingly, on the right side an upper relatively outer finger <b>118</b> extends from an upper relatively outer finger <b>118</b> proximal end <b>120</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>68</b> of the right side wing <b>62</b> downwardly to an upper relatively outer finger <b>118</b> distal end <b>122</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0030\" num=\"0030\">[0030] Again on the left side, a lower relatively outer finger <b>132</b> extends from a lower relatively outer finger <b>132</b> proximal end <b>134</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>66</b> of the left side wing <b>60</b> upwardly to a lower relatively outer finger <b>132</b> distal end <b>136</b>. The left side upper and lower relatively outer fingers <b>112</b> and <b>132</b> thus define a left side outer finger pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a lower relatively inner finger <b>138</b> extends from a lower relatively inner finger <b>138</b> proximal end <b>140</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>70</b> of the right side wing <b>62</b> upwardly to a lower relatively inner finger <b>138</b> distal end <b>142</b>. The right side upper and lower relatively outer fingers <b>118</b> and <b>138</b> thus define a right side outer finger pair. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0031\" num=\"0031\">[0031] A left side relatively outer gap <b>144</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>116</b> and <b>136</b> of the left side outer finger pair <b>112</b>, <b>132</b>. Similarly, a right side outer gap <b>146</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>122</b> and <b>142</b> of the right side upper and lower outer finger pair <b>118</b>, <b>138</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0032\" num=\"0032\">[0032] On the left side, the upper and lower relatively outer fingers <b>112</b> and <b>132</b>, in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers <b>72</b> and <b>92</b> together define a generally vertically extending relatively outer left side slot <b>148</b> accessed via the relatively outer gap <b>144</b>. Correspondingly, the right side upper and lower relatively outer fingers <b>118</b> and <b>138</b>, in cooperation with the upper and lower relatively inner fingers <b>78</b> and <b>98</b>, define a generally vertically extending relatively outer right side slot <b>150</b>, accessed via the right side relatively outer gap <b>146</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0033\" num=\"0033\">[0033] With reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and <b>8</b>, for installation and use, the user sits in the vehicle seat <b>22</b>, with the lap belt <b>26</b> and shoulder strap <b>28</b> in the correct position. With particular reference to FIG. 6, the fingers <b>72</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>138</b> are flexed as needed to position the shoulder strap <b>28</b> between the relatively inner finger pairs <b>72</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>78</b>, <b>98</b> and the central portion <b>52</b>, passing through the relatively inner left and right side slots <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. Insertion of the shoulder strap <b>28</b> is made possible on the left side by the gaps <b>104</b> and <b>144</b> and, on the right side, by the gaps <b>106</b> and <b>146</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0034\" num=\"0034\">[0034] Then, and with particular reference to FIG. 7, the relatively outer finger pairs <b>112</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>118</b>, <b>138</b> are flexed as needed, and the lap belt <b>26</b> is positioned between the outer finger pairs <b>112</b>, <b>132</b> and the inner finger pairs <b>72</b>, <b>92</b> and <b>78</b>, <b>98</b>, passing through the relatively outer left and right side slots <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. (In FIG. 7, for purposes of illustration, the shoulder strap <b>28</b> is not shown.) Insertion of the lap belt <b>26</b> is made possible by the relatively outer left and right side gaps <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0035\" num=\"0035\">[0035] However, it is not necessary for the lap belt <b>26</b> to fully engage the relatively outer left and right side slots <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. Thus, it is sufficient for the lap belt <b>26</b>, or at least the lower edge thereof, to engage only the lower relatively outer fingers <b>132</b> and <b>138</b>. Engagement with the upper relatively outer fingers <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> is not required. In any event, in the final installed configuration, the lap belt <b>26</b> and shoulder strap <b>28</b> cross over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, and cross over portions of the rear surface <b>56</b> of the central portion <b>52</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0036\" num=\"0036\">[0036] The repositioner <b>34</b> is then slid to the left or right, as required, to allow the shoulder strap <b>28</b> to ride in the most comfortable position midway between the neck <b>40</b> and shoulder, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The grip provided by the finger pairs <b>72</b>, <b>92</b>; <b>78</b>, <b>98</b>; <b>112</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>118</b>, <b>138</b> and the central portion <b>52</b> allows the repositioner <b>34</b> to be held in place, while still allowing the user to move the repositioner <b>34</b> left or right along the lap belt <b>26</b> to provide a comfortable fit of the diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b> for the user. The grip is aided by a bead <b>152</b> along the edges of the slots <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. The bead <b>152</b> actually extends continuously along all exposed edges of the body <b>50</b>, thus avoiding sharp edges. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0037\" num=\"0037\">[0037] The material has the correct combination of stiffness and flexibility to allow the finger pairs <b>72</b>, <b>92</b>; <b>78</b>, <b>98</b>; <b>112</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>118</b>, <b>138</b> to hold the repositioner <b>34</b> in place. In addition, the relatively outer finger pairs <b>112</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>118</b>, <b>138</b> flex in the event of an accident in order to allow the shoulder strap <b>28</b> to separate from the lap belt <b>26</b> and move to an optimum position of the diagonal shoulder strap <b>28</b> in order to protect the user in a manner consistent with the designed function of the vehicle seat belt assembly <b>24</b>. In the alternative attachment connection, wherein the lap belt <b>26</b> is engaged only by the lower relatively outer fingers <b>132</b> and <b>138</b>, the same result is achieved. In either event, the repositioner <b>34</b> remains attached to the diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b>, and so does not become a projectile in the event of an accident. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0038\" num=\"0038\">[0038] Further, to prevent distortion during use, the central portion.<b>52</b> is relatively rigid compared to the fingers <b>72</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>92</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>138</b>. The profile of the central portion <b>52</b>, as is perhaps best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 5, aids in maintaining rigidity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0039\" num=\"0039\">[0039] With reference now to FIG. 9, depicted is another repositioner <b>160</b> embodiment, differing from the repositioner <b>34</b> of FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> in that on each side there is only a single finger pair, and a single slot. In other respects, the FIG. 9 repositioner <b>160</b> is similar to the repositioner <b>34</b> of FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>, and the side elevational view of FIG. 3, as well as the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 4 and 5 are applicable. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0040\" num=\"0040\">[0040] Like the repositioner <b>34</b>, the repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9 comprises a body <b>162</b>, also molded in one piece of a plastic such as LLDPE, or some other material which has a suitable combination of stiffness and flexibility to function as described herein. The repositioner <b>160</b> is symmetrical about a vertical center line, so that it can be used with right-hand or left-hand vehicle seat belt assemblies <b>24</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0041\" num=\"0041\">[0041] The repositioner body <b>162</b> has a central portion <b>164</b> which is generally convex when viewed from the front as in FIG. 9, with a central ornamental feature <b>166</b>. The ornamental feature <b>166</b> takes the form of a concave recess when viewed from the front. The central portion <b>164</b> has a rear surface that faces the torso <b>36</b> during use (like the rear surface <b>56</b>), and an opposed front surface <b>168</b>. The body <b>162</b> of the repositioner <b>160</b> is curved to accommodate the pelvic contour of the user. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0042\" num=\"0042\">[0042] Integrally attached to the central portion <b>164</b> are a left side wing <b>170</b> and a right side wing <b>172</b>. The left side wing <b>170</b> in turn includes an upper base portion <b>174</b> and a lower base portion <b>176</b>. Correspondingly, the right side wing <b>172</b> in turn includes an upper base portion <b>178</b> and a lower base portion <b>180</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0043\" num=\"0043\">[0043] On the left side, a single upper finger <b>182</b> extends from an upper finger <b>182</b> proximal end <b>184</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>174</b> downwardly to an upper finger <b>182</b> distal end <b>186</b>. Correspondingly, on the right side, a single upper finger <b>188</b> extends from an upper finger <b>188</b> proximal end <b>190</b> attached to the upper base portion <b>178</b> downwardly to an upper finger <b>188</b> distal end <b>192</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0044\" num=\"0044\">[0044] Again on the left side, a single lower finger <b>202</b> extends from a lower finger <b>202</b> proximal end <b>204</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>176</b> of the left side wing <b>170</b> upwardly to a lower finger <b>202</b> distal end <b>206</b>. The left side upper and lower fingers <b>182</b> and <b>202</b> thus define a left side pair. Correspondingly, on the right side, a single lower finger <b>208</b> extends from a lower relatively inner finger <b>208</b> proximal end <b>210</b> attached to the lower base portion <b>180</b> of the right side wing <b>172</b> upwardly to a lower finger <b>208</b> distal end <b>212</b>. The right side upper and lower fingers <b>188</b> and <b>208</b> thus define a right side finger pair. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0045\" num=\"0045\">[0045] The fingers <b>182</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> are more than twice as wide as the individual fingers of the repositioner <b>34</b>, and in effect are evolved from the embodiment of FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b> by the addition of connecting webs <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>. Openings <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> defined as a result are non-functional, and ornamental in nature. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0046\" num=\"0046\">[0046] A left side gap <b>236</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>186</b> and <b>206</b> of the left side finger pair <b>182</b>, <b>202</b>. A right side gap <b>238</b> is defined between the distal ends <b>192</b> and <b>212</b> of the right side finger pair <b>188</b>, <b>208</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0047\" num=\"0047\">[0047] The left side upper finger <b>182</b> and the left side lower finger <b>202</b>, in cooperation with the central portion <b>164</b>, together define a single generally vertically extending left side slot <b>240</b>, accessed via the left side gap <b>236</b>. Correspondingly, the right side upper finger <b>188</b> and the right side lower finger <b>208</b>, in cooperation with the central portion <b>164</b>, together define a single generally vertically extending right side slot <b>242</b>, accessed via the right side gap <b>238</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0048\" num=\"0048\">[0048] For installation and use, the user sits in the vehicle seat <b>22</b>, with the lap belt <b>26</b> and shoulder strap <b>28</b> in the correct position. The fingers <b>182</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> are flexed as needed to position the shoulder strap <b>28</b> between the finger pairs <b>182</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>188</b>, <b>208</b> and the central portion <b>164</b>, passing through the left and right side slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. Insertion of the shoulder strap <b>28</b> is made possible on the left side by the gap <b>236</b> and, on the right side, by the gap <b>238</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0049\" num=\"0049\">[0049] Then, the same fingers <b>182</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> are again flexed as needed, and the lap belt <b>26</b> is positioned so as to pass through the same slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. Insertion of the lap belt <b>26</b> is likewise made possible by the left and right side gaps <b>236</b> and <b>238</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0050\" num=\"0050\">[0050] However, it is not necessary for the lap belt <b>26</b> to fully engage the left and right side slots <b>236</b> and <b>238</b>. Thus, it is sufficient for the lap belt <b>26</b>, or at least the lower edge thereof, to engage only the lower fingers <b>202</b> and <b>208</b>. Engagement with the upper fingers <b>182</b> and <b>188</b> is not required. In any event, in the final installed configuration, the lap belt <b>26</b> and shoulder strap <b>28</b> cross over portions of the front surfaces of the side wings <b>170</b> and <b>172</b>, and cross over portions of the rear surface of the central portion <b>164</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0051\" num=\"0051\">[0051] As in the case of the repositioner <b>34</b>, the repositioner <b>160</b> is then slid to the left or right, as required, to allow the shoulder strap <b>28</b> to ride in the most comfortable position midway between the neck <b>40</b> and shoulder, in the same manner as is illustrated in FIG. 1. The grip provided by the finger pairs <b>182</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>188</b>, <b>208</b>, and the central portion <b>164</b>, allows the repositioner <b>160</b> to be held in place, while still allowing the user to move the repositioner <b>160</b> left or right along the lap belt <b>26</b> to provide a comfortable fit of the diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b> for the user. The grip is aided by a bead <b>244</b> along the edges of the slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0052\" num=\"0052\">[0052] The bead <b>244</b> actually extends continuously along all exposed edges of the body <b>162</b>, thus avoiding sharp edges. In addition, the edges of the ornamental openings <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> have individual continuous beads <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> and <b>252</b>, respectively, along their edges. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0053\" num=\"0053\">[0053] The repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9 functions generally in the same manner as the repositioner <b>34</b> of FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b>. Having the lap belt <b>26</b> and the diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b> pass through the same pair of slots <b>240</b> (on the left side) and <b>242</b> (on the right side) is similar in result. The finger pairs <b>182</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>188</b>, <b>208</b> flex in the event of an accident in order to allow the shoulder strap <b>28</b> to separate from the lap belt <b>26</b> and move to an optimum position of the diagonal shoulder strap <b>28</b> in order to protect the user in a manner consistent with the designed function of the vehicle seat belt assembly <b>24</b>. In the alternative attachment connection, wherein the lap belt <b>26</b> is engaged only by the lower fingers <b>202</b> and <b>208</b>, the same result is achieved. In either event, the repositioner <b>160</b> remains attached to the diagonally-extending shoulder strap <b>28</b>, and so does not become a projectile in the event of an accident. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0054\" num=\"0054\">[0054] Likewise, to prevent distortion during use, the central portion <b>164</b> is relatively rigid compared to the fingers <b>182</b>, <b>188</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>206</b>. The profile of the central portion <b>164</b> (which is substantially identical to the profile of the central portion <b>52</b> of the repositioner <b>34</b> embodiment, as perhaps best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 5), aids in maintaining rigidity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0055\" num=\"0055\">[0055] It may be noted that the repositioner <b>34</b> of FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b> is capable of being installed in the same manner as the repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9, by ignoring the relatively outer left and right side slots <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>, and employing only the relatively inner left and right side slots <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> in the same manner as the single left and right side slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> of the repositioner <b>160</b> embodiment of FIG. 9. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0056\" num=\"0056\">[0056] Referring finally to FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>, depicted is a third repositioner <b>260</b> embodiment, which differs from the repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9 in that a foam backing <b>262</b> is included, for added user comfort. As is best seen in the rear elevational view of FIG. 12, the foam backing <b>262</b> is cut out to conform to the left and right side slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>, as well as the left and right side gaps <b>236</b> and <b>238</b> that provide access. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0057\" num=\"0057\">[0057] In all other respects, the repositioner <b>260</b> of FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b> is substantially identical to the repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9, and identical reference numerals are accordingly employed as a matter of convenience. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0058\" num=\"0058\">[0058] As seen in the rear elevational view of FIG. 12, the foam backing <b>262</b> is cut so as to be positioned just inside the bead <b>244</b> along the outer edge of the body <b>162</b>, and along the edges of the left and right side gaps <b>236</b> and <b>238</b> and the left and right side slots <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. However, in the illustrated embodiment, the foam backing <b>262</b> extends entirely across the ornamental openings <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>. The foam backing <b>262</b> is thus partially visible in the front elevational view of FIG. 10. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0059\" num=\"0059\">[0059] The repositioner <b>260</b> of FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b> is installed and functions in the same manner as the repositioner <b>160</b> of FIG. 9. Accordingly, the descriptions of that installation and operation are not repeated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0060\" num=\"0060\">[0060] While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is realized that numerous modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",
