Fraser, Detroit, Mich., assigner e American Brake Shoe Company, Wilmington, Del., a corporation of Delaware Application February 8, 1947, Serial No. 727,369  \\n  This invention relates to bearings and particularly to slipper bearingsfor universal couplings and the like.  \\n  Where power is to be transmitted between two shafts that are disposed in an end to end relationship, it is usually desirable to connect such shafts by means of a universal coupling so that misalignment of the two shafts will not cause breakage in the power transmitting connection between the two shafts. Many different types circumstances, the particular type that is employed being determined in a large measure by the environment in which the couplingis to be used and the character and amount of the torque loads that are to be transmitted. In one conventional form of universal coupling that has y cessed transversely with respect to the Vaxis of the shaft upon which the female member is mounted,  \\n and such recesses are located so as to be disposed in opposing relation to vthe, opposite side faces of the tongue when the tonguenisl inserted into the bifurcation, and this serves to dene a pair of opposed,semi-cylindrical pockets affording arcuate bearing surfaces located on opposite sides of the tongue. Each of the aforesaid pockets or recesses serves to receive&#39;a slipper bearing and such slipper bearing has a convex bearing surface that conforms to the &#39;arcuate bearing surface of the recess, and it also has anoppositely facing flat bearing face that conforms to the adjacent flat face of the tongue, and a shouldered bearing pin which passes through a suitable opening or slot in the tongue serves tomaintain I the s&#39;lipper&#39;bearings in spaced relation., Where &#34;the connected shafts are so located that they are not in axial alignment, thev angular relation of the tongue andthe female member changes constantly so that the slipper bearings rock within the recesses in the female member and .upon the arcuate bearing surfaces affordedv in such recess,` while the tongue pivots about the bearing pin and in contact with the at bearing face of the slipper bearings, and thus two angularly related axes Vare Aafforded in such a ,coupling about which&#34; the associated shafts may The branches or arms of of universal couplings are&#39;employed under such Y slipper bearing. 305,696, patented December 22,1942, a slipperY 15 claims. (c1. isi- 7)v pivot in the course of such rotation of the shafts.  \\n  In avuniversal coupling of the character described, it is customary to afford a boss which has an opening therein that serves as `a socket to receive the reduced end of the spacing or bearing pin, and this boss section is usually of a. greater thickness than the end portions of the bearing. The arcuate recesses are accordingly made&#39;somewhat deeper at the central portions Where the boss section is to be located, thereby to afford shoulders against which the end edges of the boss sections may bear so as to hold the slipper bearings in a properly centered relation- Yship within the recesses endvvise thereof.  \\n  In a universal coupling of the aforesaid character, the major portion of the wear upon the parts of the coupling has been found to occur near the end portions of the arcuate bearing surfaces of the slipper bearings and near the end portions of the arcuate bearing recesses in the female member, and the amount of wear becomes progressively greater toward the outer edges of the coupling. The female portions of such a coupling of course become worn, and when it becomes necessary to replace one slipper bearing with another, there are instances where, until the new slipper bearing becomes worn so as to conform with the worn portions of the female member, the slipper bearing will be subjected to appreciable stresses which tend to break the slipper bearing. Under such circumstances, the application of driving torque between the two members of the coupling tends to bend the&#39;slipper bearing so as to conform with the worn surfaces of the female member of the coupling, and this action tends to produce breakage of the vslipper bearings adjacent to the boss portion -thereof. Such breakage may of course occur at any time during&#39;the life of such a slipper bearing, and when such breakage occurs, it is necessary to stop the machine that is being driven by the universal coupling and to remove the broken slipper bearing and replace the same with a new In. the Healy Patent No. 2,-  \\n bearing structure is disclosed wherein each slipper bearing is made in three pieces so as to afford separately formed end sections disposed at opposite ends of a separately formed central or boss section, and means are afforded for holding the end sections in the position in such a way that these end&#39;sections may be released and removed and female members of the universal coupling.  \\n In the Healy Patent No. 2,395,697, and in the Irvin Patent No. 2,305,698, slipper bearing arrangements are disclosed wherein separately formed end sections are pivotally related to separately formed central or boss sections in such a way that endwise removability of the end sections is attained, and in addition, the end sections are permitted to adjust themselves to the worn bearing surfaces of the universal coupling without the creation of undue stresses and strains between the connected parts of the slipper bearing. In the Irvin Patent No. 2,305,702, and in the Smith Patent No. 2,305,703, other forms of slipper bearing construction are illustrated wherein end- Wise removability of the end sections of the slipper bearings is attained while at the same time providing for limited readjustment of the relationship of the parts of the slipper bearings without the creation of undue stresses between the connected parts.  \\n  The present invention constitutes an improvement upon the construction shown in the aforesaid I-Iealy, Irvin and VSmith patents, and the primary object of the present invention is to enable separately formed end sections and boss sections in a slipper bearing to be related one to the other in such a manner as to reduce the stresses upon the metallic parts that are used in connecting such elements of the slipper bearings, and an object related to the foregoing is to enable metallic elements utilized in associating such parts of a slipper bearing to be disposed about the edges of such slipper bearings, thereby to avoid the necessity for drilling or molding bores or other openings in such slipper bearings which might tend to weaken such slipper bearings.  \\n  Other important objects of the present invention are to simplify the connecting means utilized in holding the separately formed elements of a multi-element slipper bearing together; to simplify the connection of such securing elements to the end sections of such a slipper bearing; to associate such holding or retaining elements with the elements of such a slipper bearing in such a way that these connecting elements will not be subjected to bending stresses at a particular point which might tend to cause breaking or crystallization of the connecting elements at this point.  \\n As hereinbefore pointed out, it has been found in practice that the major portion of the wear in a universal coupling of the type hereinbefore described takes place at the point where the arcuate bearing surface thereof engages the arcuate surface of the female member of the coupling and a further important object of the ,present invention is to enable end sections for use in a three-part slipper bearing to be so` constructed that each end section has the arcuate bearing surface thereof afforded as a removable or replaceable element. Another and related Objectis to enable each end section in such a multi-part slipper bearing to be made in two parts, one of which is arranged for bearing contact with the fiat surface of the vtongue of the shtail, while the other is arranged forcontact with the arcuate surface of the female member of a universal coupling. More specifically, it is an object of this invention to afford a two-element end section for such a slipper bearing, and to make the arcuate bearing element thereof from a molded composition bearing material while making the fiat surface element thereof from a suitable bearing metal. Another object is to afford means for detachably associating such an arcuate bearing member and the flat base element to form the end section of a slipper bearing, and to enable th two elements of such an end section to be readily assembled and disassembled.  \\n  A further object of the present invention is to enable removable end sections of such a threepart slipper bearing to be connected together by connecting straps or bars extending along the ide edges of the end sections and the boss section, and to enable such connection to be attained by pivotal means affording pivotal axes disposed perpendicular to the axis of the socket of the boss section.  \\n  Other and further objects are to aiord attaching ears on the end sections so as to extend outwardly from the outer ends or corners of such end sections, and Vto afford connecting openings in such connecting ears so as to be disposed parallel to the flat bearing surface of such end sections and also parallel to the adjacent end face of the end section.  \\n  Other and further objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description and claims and are illustrated in the accompanying drawings which, by way of illustration, show preferred embodiments and the principles thereof and what I now consider to be the best mode in which I have contemplated applying those principles. Other embodiments of the invention embodying the same or equivalent principles may be used and structural changes may be made as desired by those skilled in the art without departing from the present invention and the purview of the appended claims.  \\n In the drawings:  \\n  Fig. 1 is a fragmentary elevational view of a portion of a rolling mill in which slipper bearings of the present invention may be employed;  \\n  Fig. 2 is an enlarged transverse cross sectional view, taken along the Yline 2 2 of Fig. 1 and showing a slipper bearing constructed in accordance with the present invention and in position in a universal coupling;  \\n  Fig. 3 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view taken substantially along the line .3 3 of Fie. 2;  \\n  Fig. 4 is a plan View of a slipper bearing embodying the features of the invention;  \\n  Fig. 5 is a side elevational View of the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. 6 is a longitudinal cross sectional View taken substantially along the line S-B of Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. &#39;7 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line &#39;1-1 of Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. 8 is an end View taken from the right in Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. V9 is a plan View of the upper or replaceable arcuate element of one end section of .the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. l0 is a side elevational View of the element shown in Fig. 9;  \\n  Fig. 11 is an end view of the element shown vin Fig. 9;  \\n  Fig. 12 is a plan View of the base element of one of the end sections of the slipper bearings shown in Fig. 4;  \\n  Fig. 13 is a side elevational View of the base section shown in Fig. 12;  \\n  Fig. 14 is an end view, taken from the right in Fig. l2;  \\n  Fig. 15 is a plan view similar to Fig. 4 and illustrating another embodiment of the invention;  \\n Fig. 16 is a side elevational View of the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 15;  \\n :taken substantially along the line I1-I&#39;I of Fig.  \\n  Fig. 18 is an end elevational view taken from the right in Fig. 15;  \\n  Fig. 19 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line I9-I9 of Fig. &#39;15; and  \\n  Fig. 20 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line 20-20 of Fig. 16.  \\n  For purposes of disclosure, the invention has been herein illustrated as mounted in a rolling mill 20 which may be of either the reversing or continuous type. The rolling mill 20 includes opposed upper and lower rolls 2I and 22 that have reduced ends or pintles 2 IA and 22A respectively that extend through and are journaled in bearings 2IB and 22B. Bearings 2IB and 22B are supported for vertical adjustment in an upstanding frame member 23, and the rolls are driven from gearing 24 that is disposed in substantially spaced relation with respect to the rolls 2| and 22 and on the opposite side of another upstanding frame member 25. The gearing 24 has projecting stub shaftS&#39;24A extended through the frame member 25, and connecting drive spindles 26 are extended between the stub shafts 24A and the reduced ends ZIA and 22A of the rolls 2l and 22. The opposite ends of the spindles 26 are connected respectively to the gearing 24 and to the rolls 2I and 22 by universal couplings 30, and it is in such couplings 30 that the slipper bearings of the present invention are employed. It will be observed that the lower spindle 26 has a central thrust bearing 3I which supports the spindle and holds the same against undue movement in an endwise direction, and a similar bearing 32 is afforded for the upper spindle 26, such bearing 32 being supported on a carrier bar 33. The carrier bar 33 is supported at its right hand end by a link 34 that is suspended from the frame member 25, while the other end of the bar 33 is pivoted at 35 on the upper bearing 2IB so as/ to maintain the bearing at 32 in a proper relation to the upper spindle 26 as the upper roll 2l is adjusted, as for example. from the full line position of the Fig. 21 to the dotted position. It is when the roll 2l and the driving spindle 26 thereof are thus misaligned that the universal action of the couplings 30 comes into play.  \\n  The universal couplings 30 each comprise a male member 30M and a female member 30F and these members are in the-form of heads which may be formed on the elements that are to be connected by the couplings, or these heads may be separately formed. The male member 30M has a flat and relatively thick tongue 30T projecting from the rounded end surface thereof, and when the elements of the coupling are in assembled relation, this tongue 30T enters into a slot 30S that is formed into the end of the female member 30F so as to afford bifurcations 30B. Between the two bifurcations 30B, an arcuate bearing recess is formed on an axis that is perpendicular to the axis of the head 30F, and substantially midway between the ends of the arcuate bearing recess 40, this recess is made substantially deeper as at 40B, thereby to afford spaced shoulders 40S along opposite sides of the recesses A pair of slipper bearings are respectively interposed between the tongue30T and the arcuate recesses that are afforded between the arms 30B of the female member 30F, and each slipper bearing 50 affords complemental surfaces for engagement respectivelywith the arcuate bearing surfaces of the female member 30F and the opposed flat surfaces of the tongue 30T. The central portion of each slipper bearing 50 is somewhat thicker than the remaining portions of the slipper bearing so that this medial portion of each slipper bearing extends into the deepened portion 40B of the recess in the female element 30F of the universal coupling. Such medial portions of the slipper bearings are separately formed and are herein designated as boss sections 50B, and end sections 50E are extended from opposite ends of the boss sections 50B to substantially the outer ends of the arcuate bearing recesses 40 of the female member 30F. The two boss sections 50B are held in spaced relation by a shouldered bearing pin 52, the reduced en&#39;ds of which extend into sockets 53 that are formed centrally of the boss sections 50B, this relationship being shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings. When the coupling is in its assembled relation, the bearing pin 52 is embraced within a slot 54 that is formed in the end of the tongue 30T, and the relationship ofthe pin 52 with the slot 54 affords a pivotal axis about which the elements of the coupling may move, it being observed of course that the slipper bearings 50 ride in the arcuate recesses 40 to afford a second pivotal axis so that the assembly constitutes a universal coupling.  \\n  The boss section 56B is in the present instance illustrated as being molded from a composition bearing material and because of this, the boss section 56B has reinforcing means molded therein so as to impart additional strength and wearing qualities thereto. The boss 55B is of course formed with an arcuate bearing surface 55 and a flat :bearing surface 56 and these surfaces 55 and 56 are joined by edge surfaces 51. At the juncture of the surfaces 56 and 5l, the boss section 56B has corner beads molded therein, as indicated at 58 in Fig. 4, and these corner beads take the general form of the reinforcing corner beads illustrated in Irvin Patent No. 2,361,629, patented October 3l, `1944. These corner beads are described in greater detail hereinafter with respect to the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. l5 to 20, but it should be herein pointed out that connecting elements 59 are extended between the corner beads 58 so as to be disposed in the body of the boss section on opposite sides of the socket 53. The corner beads 58 and the connecting members 59 are both formed from a suita-ble bearing metal, thereby to impart additional strength to the boss section 56B. For purposes that will hereinafter become apparent, each corner bead 58 has a supporting pin 60 fixed therein with a press t and extended outwardly beyond the side surfaces 5l&#39; of the boss section.  \\n  The end sections 50E of the slipper bearing 50 are, in the form of the invention shown in Figs.  \\n ` 1 to 14, comprised in each instance from a pair of separably formed elements, one of which may be termed&#39;a base member 62 While the other of Which may be termed a cap member 63, these parts being individually designated in Figs. 4 to 8 of lthe drawings and being separately illustrated respectively in Figs. 12 to 14 and 9 to 11.  \\n  The base member 62 and the cap member 63 are both generally rectangular inform, and the base member has a flat bottom surface 62E&#39; that is adapted to bear upon the at side surface of the tongue 39T of the universal coupling. The basemember 62 is therefore made of a suitable bearing metal, and means are afforded whereby arse alava the cap member G3 &#39;ray be secured Yin plac on the other Aface of `the base member `B2 so as to Ythereby afford an arcuate bearing lsurface 63A for bea-ring engagement with the arcuate recess l0 `of the female member of Athe coupling.  \\n - Although any suitable bearing material may be utilized for the cap member 63, I prefer to form this cap member from a composition bear-- ing material rather than from metal. In forming the cap member @3, means are aiorded for cooperation with complemental means on the base member S2 for holding the two members in assembled relation, and in the form herein illustrated, these means are in the nature of a dovetail joint. Ihus the upper surface of the base member 62 is generally flat as indicated at 62U in Figs. l2 to 14, and a longitudinal rib 6G is iormed along the surface @2U to serve as a portion of the fastening means for assembling the memm bers &#39;52 and t3 of the end section. The rib 55 ais of generally dovetail form, and is adapted to receive within a complemental dovetail groove `6&#39;! which is formed, as shown in Figs. 9 to 11, in the ilat lower surface @3L of the cap member 53. Thus the cap member may be put in position on the base member 52? by endwise movement in which the rib 66 is inserted into the dov-etail groove 6l, and under the present invention, this assembly, is attained by movement of the cap member B3 in a right-hand direction. With respect to the base member s2 as viewed in Figs. 12 and 13. In the course of such an endwise assembly movement, the right hand end of the cap member 63 Will engage an abutment wall G9 o-n the base 62 when the assembly movement has been completed, and as will hereinafter become apparent, the abutment wall 59 will, when the elements of the slipper bearing are assembled, serve to prevent disassembly of the cap element 63 with relation to the base member 62.  \\n  In forming a complete slipper bearing i?, one end section SE is disposed opposite each end of the boss section EQB, and means are afforded for holding these three elements in assembled relationship. Such means are so formed and related to the elements of the slipper bearing that the end sections 5E may be removed and replaced while the coupling in which it is used remains in its coupled relationship, and under and in accordance with the present invention, these securing means are of such a character that they may be disposed entirely outside of the body of the various elements of the slipper bearing. Thus in ac cordance with the present invention, a pair of elongated and flat securing bars F9 are extended along the side edges of the boss section 53B and along the side edges of the end sections 50E, and in this connection, it should be observed that the arcuate and ilat surfaces of the end sections 50E are connected by side edges 57E that are similar in form and relation to the side edges 51 of the boss section. The connecting bars 1U, at substantially the midpoints thereof, are provided with apertures Il which are arranged to embrace the supporting pins 6B that extend from the sides of the boss section EJB, and thus, so long as the bars &#39;i0 are held against the side edges 5&#39;! of the boss EB, these bars will be held in assembled relationship with respect to the boss section 50B. The bars l0 extend somewhat beyond the ends of the end sections EtE of the slipper bearing, as will be evident in Figs. 4 to 6 of the drawings, and at the outer ends of the end sections, that is, the ends thereof at which the abutment walls 59 are located, these end sections have attaching ears l&#34;T2 formed &#39;integrally with the base member 62&#34;.  \\n These attaching ears l2 are disposed at the outer corners of the base members 52 of the &#39;end sections so as to be parallel to and in contact with the ends of the connecting bars l0, and apertures &#34;I3 are formed in the ears l2 parallel to the ends of the end sections and parallel to the flat bearing surfaces of such end sections. Thus when the end section 55E is placed in position in abutment with the end of the boss section 50B, the apertures &#39;I3 in the ears FEZ are aligned with corresponding openings formed in the ends of the connecting bars Iii, and securing pins &#39;I4 are eX- tended through each such pair of aligned openings, thereby to connect each ear &#39;i2 with the adjacent connecting strap 10. The pins &#39;le may of course be held in position by diierent types of securing means, lbut as herein shown, the pins &#39;14 are held releasably in position by spring clips or washers l5 of conventional form that are engaged with suitable annular grooves formed in the connecting pins 14. When the parts of the bearing are thus assembled, the bars &#39;sil are held against the side edges&#39; of the end sections and the boss section, and hence the bars &#39;ill are held in position on the supporting pins ii. This of course holds the entire assembly together.  \\n  In the form of the invention shown in Figs. 1 to le of the drawings, the attaching earsS are formed integrally with the base member v62, and when the parts have been assembled in the manner indicated in Figs. 1 to 6 of the drawings, the  \\n end sections 5-&#39;JE will Abe held against the ends of the boss section 59B and will be supported through the action of the pins 6@ so that the flat bearing surfaces 55 and @2F will be in substantial alignment. Hence when the two slipper bearings that are to be used in a coupling are mounted on a bearing pin 52, these two slipper bearings will be held in properly spaced relation within the female member of the coupling so as to. thereby enable the tongue 3ST to -be readily inserted into position. When the two-part end sections are thus secured to a boss section 50B, the cap member 63 will be held against movement in one` direction by engagement with the boss section, while the abutment wall E5 will prevent rel-r ative displacement in the other direction. When however it becomes necessary to replace a cap member 63, the end section of which it constitutes a part may be released by removal of the pins i4, and the entire end section may be withdrawn in an endwise direction from the coupling without the necessity for separating the coupling. The Worn cap member may then of course be replaced on the base section S2, and the two-part end section may then be inserted into the coupling and connected to the connecting bars l@ by the connecting pins &#39;M j Although the two-part end section illustrated in Figs. l to 14 of thedrawings is desirable in many installations, certain of the elements or aspects of the present invention may be utilized apart Yfrom&#39;the use of a two-part end section, and in Figs. 15 to 20 of the drawings, such an embodiment of the invention has been illustrated. In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 15 to 20 of the drawings, the slipper bearing is made up 0f a boss section 56B of same construction as the boss section utilized in the previously described embodiment of the invention, and separately formed end sections SUEZ are associated with the boss section eilB by means of the supporting pins 6c and connecting bars l0 in substantially the same manner as hereinbefore described.  \\n  forcingcorner beads 58 connected by cross members 59 that art moldedinto the material of the boss section. In Fig. 20 of the drawings a cross sectional view of the boss section 50B is shown, and it will be evident in this View that the corner fbeads 58 are of the same general form as the corner beads illustrated and described in the aforesaid Irvin Patent No. 2,361,629, it being observed however that the outer edges of these corner beads as utilized in the present instance are square rather than rounded as in the aforesaid Irvin patent. It will be recognized however that rounded edges may be utilized in many instances. It will be noted .in Fig. 20 that the corner beads 58 yhave ribbed anchoring arms 58A formed thereon as described in the aforesaid Irvin patent so that these arms 58A will be eifectuallyanchored in the course of the molding of the boss section 56B. In the aforesaid Irvin patent, the connecting arms that extend between two corner beads are separately formed, but in the present instance the connectingI elements 59 have been illustrated as being permanently and integrally connected to the corner beads 58.&#39; The corner beads 58 serve in the present instance to support the pins 50, and as will be evident in Fig. 20, these pins `60 may be assembled or put in place on the respective corner beads 58 by a press fit in a suitable reamed bore. 1  \\n  The end sections 50E2 that are shown in Figs. 15 to 19 are also molded from a composition bearing material, andcorner beads |58`are afforded therein in the same general manner as in the boss section 50B. The corner beads |58Y are joined by aconnecting member |59 that correspond in form and function with the connecting members 5&amp;1,y and hence the end sections 50E2 have permanent# l ly related corner beads along opposite edgesY thereof at the juncture of the flat bottom surface |60 with the side edges of the end sections. At the end of the end section which is to be disposed outwardly in the slipper bearing, the corner beadsv |58 are formed to afford &#39;connecting ears |12 Whichhave bores |13 therein so that these ears correspond in form and function with the ears 12 in the previous described embodiment of the invention. When the slipper bearingshown in Figs. 15 to 20 is to be assembled, the end sections tionship that hasY thus been established.  \\n With this embodiment of the invention, the eletherefrom, andmeans supporting said sections in f claims.  \\n Y in place by means that .do not extend through the body of the slipper bearing. In other words, the  \\n holding-means are disposed entirely on the outside ofthe/slipper bearing so that&#39; the slipper bearing has maximum strength, and with this arrangement there is no tendency to break thev holding or securing means.  \\n It will also be evident that under the present invention, the end sections&#39; of the slipper bearing may be formed in two parts so as to thereby enable the fast Wearingelements of the end sections to be replaced. Under the present invention, the  \\n foregoing advantages are attained in such a way.  \\n that replacement of worn elements of the slipper bearing may be attained without disassembly ofpreferred embodiments of my invention, it is to be understood that these`are;capab1e.of variation and modification and I therefore do not Wish to be limited to the precise details set forth, but desire to avail myself of such changes and alterations as fall within the Apurview of the following I claim:  \\n 1.

The arcuate recesses are accordingly made\\'somewhat deeper at the central portions Where the boss section is to be located, thereby to afford shoulders against which the end edges of the boss sections may bear so as to hold the slipper bearings in a properly centered relation- Yship within the recesses endvvise thereof. </p>\\n<p> In a universal coupling of the aforesaid character, the major portion of the wear upon the parts of the coupling has been found to occur near the end portions of the arcuate bearing surfaces of the slipper bearings and near the end portions of the arcuate bearing recesses in the female member, and the amount of wear becomes progressively greater toward the outer edges of the coupling. The female portions of such a coupling of course become worn, and when it becomes necessary to replace one slipper bearing with another, there are instances where, until the new slipper bearing becomes worn so as to conform with the worn portions of the female member, the slipper bearing will be subjected to appreciable stresses which tend to break the slipper bearing. Under such circumstances, the application of driving torque between the two members of the coupling tends to bend the\\'slipper bearing so as to conform with the worn surfaces of the female member of the coupling, and this action tends to produce breakage of the vslipper bearings adjacent to the boss portion -thereof. Such breakage may of course occur at any time during\\'the life of such a slipper bearing, and when such breakage occurs, it is necessary to stop the machine that is being driven by the universal coupling and to remove the broken slipper bearing and replace the same with a new In. the Healy Patent No. 2,- </p>\\n<p>bearing structure is disclosed wherein each slipper bearing is made in three pieces so as to afford separately formed end sections disposed at opposite ends of a separately formed central or boss section, and means are afforded for holding the end sections in the position in such a way that these end\\'sections may be released and removed and female members of the universal coupling. </p>\\n<p>In the Healy Patent No. 2,395,697, and in the Irvin Patent No. 2,305,698, slipper bearing arrangements are disclosed wherein separately formed end sections are pivotally related to separately formed central or boss sections in such a way that endwise removability of the end sections is attained, and in addition, the end sections are permitted to adjust themselves to the worn bearing surfaces of the universal coupling without the creation of undue stresses and strains between the connected parts of the slipper bearing. In the Irvin Patent No. 2,305,702, and in the Smith Patent No. 2,305,703, other forms of slipper bearing construction are illustrated wherein end- Wise removability of the end sections of the slipper bearings is attained while at the same time providing for limited readjustment of the relationship of the parts of the slipper bearings without the creation of undue stresses between the connected parts. </p>\\n<p> The present invention constitutes an improvement upon the construction shown in the aforesaid I-Iealy, Irvin and VSmith patents, and the primary object of the present invention is to enable separately formed end sections and boss sections in a slipper bearing to be related one to the other in such a manner as to reduce the stresses upon the metallic parts that are used in connecting such elements of the slipper bearings, and an object related to the foregoing is to enable metallic elements utilized in associating such parts of a slipper bearing to be disposed about the edges of such slipper bearings, thereby to avoid the necessity for drilling or molding bores or other openings in such slipper bearings which might tend to weaken such slipper bearings. </p>\\n<p> Other important objects of the present invention are to simplify the connecting means utilized in holding the separately formed elements of a multi-element slipper bearing together; to simplify the connection of such securing elements to the end sections of such a slipper bearing; to associate such holding or retaining elements with the elements of such a slipper bearing in such a way that these connecting elements will not be subjected to bending stresses at a particular point which might tend to cause breaking or crystallization of the connecting elements at this point. </p>\\n<p>As hereinbefore pointed out, it has been found in practice that the major portion of the wear in a universal coupling of the type hereinbefore described takes place at the point where the arcuate bearing surface thereof engages the arcuate surface of the female member of the coupling and a further important object of the ,present invention is to enable end sections for use in a three-part slipper bearing to be so` constructed that each end section has the arcuate bearing surface thereof afforded as a removable or replaceable element. Another and related Objectis to enable each end section in such a multi-part slipper bearing to be made in two parts, one of which is arranged for bearing contact with the fiat surface of the vtongue of the shtail, while the other is arranged forcontact with the arcuate surface of the female member of a universal coupling. More specifically, it is an object of this invention to afford a two-element end section for such a slipper bearing, and to make the arcuate bearing element thereof from a molded composition bearing material while making the fiat surface element thereof from a suitable bearing metal. Another object is to afford means for detachably associating such an arcuate bearing member and the flat base element to form the end section of a slipper bearing, and to enable th two elements of such an end section to be readily assembled and disassembled. </p>\\n<p> A further object of the present invention is to enable removable end sections of such a threepart slipper bearing to be connected together by connecting straps or bars extending along the ide edges of the end sections and the boss section, and to enable such connection to be attained by pivotal means affording pivotal axes disposed perpendicular to the axis of the socket of the boss section. </p>\\n<p> Other and further objects are to aiord attaching ears on the end sections so as to extend outwardly from the outer ends or corners of such end sections, and Vto afford connecting openings in such connecting ears so as to be disposed parallel to the flat bearing surface of such end sections and also parallel to the adjacent end face of the end section. </p>\\n<p> Other and further objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description and claims and are illustrated in the accompanying drawings which, by way of illustration, show preferred embodiments and the principles thereof and what I now consider to be the best mode in which I have contemplated applying those principles. Other embodiments of the invention embodying the same or equivalent principles may be used and structural changes may be made as desired by those skilled in the art without departing from the present invention and the purview of the appended claims. </p>\\n<p>In the drawings: </p>\\n<p> Fig. 1 is a fragmentary elevational view of a portion of a rolling mill in which slipper bearings of the present invention may be employed; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 2 is an enlarged transverse cross sectional view, taken along the Yline 2 2 of Fig. 1 and showing a slipper bearing constructed in accordance with the present invention and in position in a universal coupling; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 3 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view taken substantially along the line .3 3 of Fie. 2; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 4 is a plan View of a slipper bearing embodying the features of the invention; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 5 is a side elevational View of the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 6 is a longitudinal cross sectional View taken substantially along the line S-B of Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. \\'7 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line \\'1-1 of Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 8 is an end View taken from the right in Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. V9 is a plan View of the upper or replaceable arcuate element of one end section of .the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. l0 is a side elevational View of the element shown in Fig. 9; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 11 is an end view of the element shown vin Fig. 9; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 12 is a plan View of the base element of one of the end sections of the slipper bearings shown in Fig. 4; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 13 is a side elevational View of the base section shown in Fig. 12; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 14 is an end view, taken from the right in Fig. l2; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 15 is a plan view similar to Fig. 4 and illustrating another embodiment of the invention; </p>\\n<p>Fig. 16 is a side elevational View of the slipper bearing shown in Fig. 15; </p>\\n<p>:taken substantially along the line I1-I\\'I of Fig. </p>\\n<p> Fig. 18 is an end elevational view taken from the right in Fig. 15; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 19 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line I9-I9 of Fig. \\'15; and </p>\\n<p> Fig. 20 is a transverse cross sectional view taken substantially along the line 20-20 of Fig. 16. </p>\\n<p> For purposes of disclosure, the invention has been herein illustrated as mounted in a rolling mill 20 which may be of either the reversing or continuous type. The rolling mill 20 includes opposed upper and lower rolls 2I and 22 that have reduced ends or pintles 2 IA and 22A respectively that extend through and are journaled in bearings 2IB and 22B. Bearings 2IB and 22B are supported for vertical adjustment in an upstanding frame member 23, and the rolls are driven from gearing 24 that is disposed in substantially spaced relation with respect to the rolls 2| and 22 and on the opposite side of another upstanding frame member 25. The gearing 24 has projecting stub shaftS\\'24A extended through the frame member 25, and connecting drive spindles 26 are extended between the stub shafts 24A and the reduced ends ZIA and 22A of the rolls 2l and 22. The opposite ends of the spindles 26 are connected respectively to the gearing 24 and to the rolls 2I and 22 by universal couplings 30, and it is in such couplings 30 that the slipper bearings of the present invention are employed. It will be observed that the lower spindle 26 has a central thrust bearing 3I which supports the spindle and holds the same against undue movement in an endwise direction, and a similar bearing 32 is afforded for the upper spindle 26, such bearing 32 being supported on a carrier bar 33. The carrier bar 33 is supported at its right hand end by a link 34 that is suspended from the frame member 25, while the other end of the bar 33 is pivoted at 35 on the upper bearing 2IB so as/ to maintain the bearing at 32 in a proper relation to the upper spindle 26 as the upper roll 2l is adjusted, as for example. from the full line position of the Fig. 21 to the dotted position. It is when the roll 2l and the driving spindle 26 thereof are thus misaligned that the universal action of the couplings 30 comes into play. </p>\\n<p> The universal couplings 30 each comprise a male member 30M and a female member 30F and these members are in the-form of heads which may be formed on the elements that are to be connected by the couplings, or these heads may be separately formed. The male member 30M has a flat and relatively thick tongue 30T projecting from the rounded end surface thereof, and when the elements of the coupling are in assembled relation, this tongue 30T enters into a slot 30S that is formed into the end of the female member 30F so as to afford bifurcations 30B. Between the two bifurcations 30B, an arcuate bearing recess is formed on an axis that is perpendicular to the axis of the head 30F, and substantially midway between the ends of the arcuate bearing recess 40, this recess is made substantially deeper as at 40B, thereby to afford spaced shoulders 40S along opposite sides of the recesses A pair of slipper bearings are respectively interposed between the tongue30T and the arcuate recesses that are afforded between the arms 30B of the female member 30F, and each slipper bearing 50 affords complemental surfaces for engagement respectivelywith the arcuate bearing surfaces of the female member 30F and the opposed flat surfaces of the tongue 30T. The central portion of each slipper bearing 50 is somewhat thicker than the remaining portions of the slipper bearing so that this medial portion of each slipper bearing extends into the deepened portion 40B of the recess in the female element 30F of the universal coupling. Such medial portions of the slipper bearings are separately formed and are herein designated as boss sections 50B, and end sections 50E are extended from opposite ends of the boss sections 50B to substantially the outer ends of the arcuate bearing recesses 40 of the female member 30F. The two boss sections 50B are held in spaced relation by a shouldered bearing pin 52, the reduced en\\'ds of which extend into sockets 53 that are formed centrally of the boss sections 50B, this relationship being shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings. When the coupling is in its assembled relation, the bearing pin 52 is embraced within a slot 54 that is formed in the end of the tongue 30T, and the relationship ofthe pin 52 with the slot 54 affords a pivotal axis about which the elements of the coupling may move, it being observed of course that the slipper bearings 50 ride in the arcuate recesses 40 to afford a second pivotal axis so that the assembly constitutes a universal coupling. </p>\\n<p> The boss section 56B is in the present instance illustrated as being molded from a composition bearing material and because of this, the boss section 56B has reinforcing means molded therein so as to impart additional strength and wearing qualities thereto. The boss 55B is of course formed with an arcuate bearing surface 55 and a flat :bearing surface 56 and these surfaces 55 and 56 are joined by edge surfaces 51. At the juncture of the surfaces 56 and 5l, the boss section 56B has corner beads molded therein, as indicated at 58 in Fig. 4, and these corner beads take the general form of the reinforcing corner beads illustrated in Irvin Patent No. 2,361,629, patented October 3l, `1944. These corner beads are described in greater detail hereinafter with respect to the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. l5 to 20, but it should be herein pointed out that connecting elements 59 are extended between the corner beads 58 so as to be disposed in the body of the boss section on opposite sides of the socket 53. The corner beads 58 and the connecting members 59 are both formed from a suita-ble bearing metal, thereby to impart additional strength to the boss section 56B. For purposes that will hereinafter become apparent, each corner bead 58 has a supporting pin 60 fixed therein with a press t and extended outwardly beyond the side surfaces 5l\\' of the boss section. </p>\\n<p> The end sections 50E of the slipper bearing 50 are, in the form of the invention shown in Figs. </p>\\n<p>` 1 to 14, comprised in each instance from a pair of separably formed elements, one of which may be termed\\'a base member 62 While the other of Which may be termed a cap member 63, these parts being individually designated in Figs. 4 to 8 of lthe drawings and being separately illustrated respectively in Figs. 12 to 14 and 9 to 11. </p>\\n<p> The base member 62 and the cap member 63 are both generally rectangular inform, and the base member has a flat bottom surface 62E\\' that is adapted to bear upon the at side surface of the tongue 39T of the universal coupling. The basemember 62 is therefore made of a suitable bearing metal, and means are afforded whereby arse alava the cap member G3 \\'ray be secured Yin plac on the other Aface of `the base member `B2 so as to Ythereby afford an arcuate bearing lsurface 63A for bea-ring engagement with the arcuate recess l0 `of the female member of Athe coupling. </p>\\n<p>- Although any suitable bearing material may be utilized for the cap member 63, I prefer to form this cap member from a composition bear-- ing material rather than from metal. In forming the cap member @3, means are aiorded for cooperation with complemental means on the base member S2 for holding the two members in assembled relation, and in the form herein illustrated, these means are in the nature of a dovetail joint. Ihus the upper surface of the base member 62 is generally flat as indicated at 62U in Figs. l2 to 14, and a longitudinal rib 6G is iormed along the surface @2U to serve as a portion of the fastening means for assembling the memm bers \\'52 and t3 of the end section. The rib 55 ais of generally dovetail form, and is adapted to receive within a complemental dovetail groove `6\\'! which is formed, as shown in Figs. 9 to 11, in the ilat lower surface @3L of the cap member 53. Thus the cap member may be put in position on the base member 52? by endwise movement in which the rib 66 is inserted into the dov-etail groove 6l, and under the present invention, this assembly, is attained by movement of the cap member B3 in a right-hand direction. With respect to the base member s2 as viewed in Figs. 12 and 13. In the course of such an endwise assembly movement, the right hand end of the cap member 63 Will engage an abutment wall G9 o-n the base 62 when the assembly movement has been completed, and as will hereinafter become apparent, the abutment wall 59 will, when the elements of the slipper bearing are assembled, serve to prevent disassembly of the cap element 63 with relation to the base member 62. </p>\\n<p> In forming a complete slipper bearing i?, one end section SE is disposed opposite each end of the boss section EQB, and means are afforded for holding these three elements in assembled relationship. Such means are so formed and related to the elements of the slipper bearing that the end sections 5E may be removed and replaced while the coupling in which it is used remains in its coupled relationship, and under and in accordance with the present invention, these securing means are of such a character that they may be disposed entirely outside of the body of the various elements of the slipper bearing. Thus in ac cordance with the present invention, a pair of elongated and flat securing bars F9 are extended along the side edges of the boss section 53B and along the side edges of the end sections 50E, and in this connection, it should be observed that the arcuate and ilat surfaces of the end sections 50E are connected by side edges 57E that are similar in form and relation to the side edges 51 of the boss section. The connecting bars 1U, at substantially the midpoints thereof, are provided with apertures Il which are arranged to embrace the supporting pins 6B that extend from the sides of the boss section EJB, and thus, so long as the bars \\'i0 are held against the side edges 5\\'! of the boss EB, these bars will be held in assembled relationship with respect to the boss section 50B. The bars l0 extend somewhat beyond the ends of the end sections EtE of the slipper bearing, as will be evident in Figs. 4 to 6 of the drawings, and at the outer ends of the end sections, that is, the ends thereof at which the abutment walls 59 are located, these end sections have attaching ears l\"T2 formed \\'integrally with the base member 62\". </p>\\n<p>These attaching ears l2 are disposed at the outer corners of the base members 52 of the \\'end sections so as to be parallel to and in contact with the ends of the connecting bars l0, and apertures \"I3 are formed in the ears l2 parallel to the ends of the end sections and parallel to the flat bearing surfaces of such end sections. Thus when the end section 55E is placed in position in abutment with the end of the boss section 50B, the apertures \\'I3 in the ears FEZ are aligned with corresponding openings formed in the ends of the connecting bars Iii, and securing pins \\'I4 are eX- tended through each such pair of aligned openings, thereby to connect each ear \\'i2 with the adjacent connecting strap 10. The pins \\'le may of course be held in position by diierent types of securing means, lbut as herein shown, the pins \\'14 are held releasably in position by spring clips or washers l5 of conventional form that are engaged with suitable annular grooves formed in the connecting pins 14. When the parts of the bearing are thus assembled, the bars \\'sil are held against the side edges\\' of the end sections and the boss section, and hence the bars \\'ill are held in position on the supporting pins ii. This of course holds the entire assembly together. </p>\\n<p> In the form of the invention shown in Figs. 1 to le of the drawings, the attaching earsS are formed integrally with the base member v62, and when the parts have been assembled in the manner indicated in Figs. 1 to 6 of the drawings, the </p>\\n<p>end sections 5-\\'JE will Abe held against the ends of the boss section 59B and will be supported through the action of the pins 6@ so that the flat bearing surfaces 55 and @2F will be in substantial alignment. Hence when the two slipper bearings that are to be used in a coupling are mounted on a bearing pin 52, these two slipper bearings will be held in properly spaced relation within the female member of the coupling so as to. thereby enable the tongue 3ST to -be readily inserted into position. When the two-part end sections are thus secured to a boss section 50B, the cap member 63 will be held against movement in one` direction by engagement with the boss section, while the abutment wall E5 will prevent rel-r ative displacement in the other direction. When however it becomes necessary to replace a cap member 63, the end section of which it constitutes a part may be released by removal of the pins i4, and the entire end section may be withdrawn in an endwise direction from the coupling without the necessity for separating the coupling. The Worn cap member may then of course be replaced on the base section S2, and the two-part end section may then be inserted into the coupling and connected to the connecting bars l@ by the connecting pins \\'M j Although the two-part end section illustrated in Figs. l to 14 of thedrawings is desirable in many installations, certain of the elements or aspects of the present invention may be utilized apart Yfrom\\'the use of a two-part end section, and in Figs. 15 to 20 of the drawings, such an embodiment of the invention has been illustrated. In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 15 to 20 of the drawings, the slipper bearing is made up 0f a boss section 56B of same construction as the boss section utilized in the previously described embodiment of the invention, and separately formed end sections SUEZ are associated with the boss section eilB by means of the supporting pins 6c and connecting bars l0 in substantially the same manner as hereinbefore described. </p>\\n<p> forcingcorner beads 58 connected by cross members 59 that art moldedinto the material of the boss section. In Fig. 20 of the drawings a cross sectional view of the boss section 50B is shown, and it will be evident in this View that the corner fbeads 58 are of the same general form as the corner beads illustrated and described in the aforesaid Irvin Patent No. 2,361,629, it being observed however that the outer edges of these corner beads as utilized in the present instance are square rather than rounded as in the aforesaid Irvin patent. It will be recognized however that rounded edges may be utilized in many instances. It will be noted .in Fig. 20 that the corner beads 58 yhave ribbed anchoring arms 58A formed thereon as described in the aforesaid Irvin patent so that these arms 58A will be eifectuallyanchored in the course of the molding of the boss section 56B. In the aforesaid Irvin patent, the connecting arms that extend between two corner beads are separately formed, but in the present instance the connectingI elements 59 have been illustrated as being permanently and integrally connected to the corner beads 58.\\' The corner beads 58 serve in the present instance to support the pins 50, and as will be evident in Fig. 20, these pins `60 may be assembled or put in place on the respective corner beads 58 by a press fit in a suitable reamed bore. 1 </p>\\n<p> The end sections 50E2 that are shown in Figs. 15 to 19 are also molded from a composition bearing material, andcorner beads |58`are afforded therein in the same general manner as in the boss section 50B. The corner beads |58Y are joined by aconnecting member |59 that correspond in form and function with the connecting members 5&amp;1,y and hence the end sections 50E2 have permanent# l ly related corner beads along opposite edgesY thereof at the juncture of the flat bottom surface |60 with the side edges of the end sections. At the end of the end section which is to be disposed outwardly in the slipper bearing, the corner beadsv |58 are formed to afford \\'connecting ears |12 Whichhave bores |13 therein so that these ears correspond in form and function with the ears 12 in the previous described embodiment of the invention. When the slipper bearingshown in Figs. 15 to 20 is to be assembled, the end sections tionship that hasY thus been established. </p>\\n<p>With this embodiment of the invention, the eletherefrom, andmeans supporting said sections in f claims. </p>\\n<p>Y in place by means that .do not extend through the body of the slipper bearing. In other words, the </p>\\n<p>holding-means are disposed entirely on the outside ofthe/slipper bearing so that\\' the slipper bearing has maximum strength, and with this arrangement there is no tendency to break thev holding or securing means. </p>\\n<p>It will also be evident that under the present invention, the end sections\\' of the slipper bearing may be formed in two parts so as to thereby enable the fast Wearingelements of the end sections to be replaced. Under the present invention, the </p>\\n<p>foregoing advantages are attained in such a way. </p>\\n<p>that replacement of worn elements of the slipper bearing may be attained without disassembly ofpreferred embodiments of my invention, it is to be understood that these`are;capab1e.of variation and modification and I therefore do not Wish to be limited to the precise details set forth, but desire to avail myself of such changes and alterations as fall within the Apurview of the following I claim: </p>\\n<p>1.

WALSH, 015&#39; BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, ASSIGNOB TO WALSH-BAKER CORPORATION, OF PORTLAND, MAINE.  \\n LOOM FOB WEAVING CANE, &amp;o.  \\n Application filed March 16, 1911.  \\n T 0 all whom it may concern:  \\n  Be it known that I, &#39;Tiiowms l. WALsH, a citizen of the United States, and resident of Boston, in the county of Suffolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Looms for \\\\Veaving Cane, &amp;c., of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like letters on the drawings representing like parts.  \\n  My invention is a loom specially adapted to weaving coarse fabrics such as are pro duced with cane, willow, wire, etc.  \\n  Besides providing weaving mechanism capable of handling the coarse, heavy, stiff strands mentioned. one object of my invention is to provide means for accomplishing the weaving rapidly, means having a considerable range of pattern variety, means for facilitating the case of handling the warp strands whereby. for instance, in the shedding operation, they are subjected to a minimum bending strain, and moreover such bending strain as is necessary is an easy strain and not tense.  \\n  The constructional details of the preferred embodiment of my invention herein contained will appear more fully from the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which I have shown a preferred embodiment of the invention.  \\n  In the drawings, Figure 1 is a central ver tical longitudinal sectional view of my preferred loom: Fig. I is a detail in side elevation of one of the pattern pins and spacers; Fig. 2 is a view thereof in front elevation; Fig. 3 is a righthand side elevation; Figs. eland 5 are enlarged fragmentary views in top plan and front elevation respectively of the two filling carriers or needles preferably used in the loom, shown in their cooperating position at the middle of the loom or end of their inner throw; Fig. (i is a sectional view showing the pin-wheel drive or lcneva movement in side elevation; Figs. 7 and 8 are devclopn&#39;ients of the pe riphery of the respective cams for operating the needles, the former for operating the supply needle and the latter for operating the nipper needle. Fig. 9 is a vertical transverse sectional view showing the selvage mechanism in front elevation; Fig. 10 is an enlarged section of the weave at the selvage; Kg. 11 is a arms-sectional detail on the line Patented Dec. 1, 1914. Serial No. 614,887.  \\n 11-1l, Fig. 9; and Figs. 12 and 13 are diagrammatic viewsshowmg various combinations of arranging the pins of the pattern mechanism for different weaves.  \\n  The warp strands 1 (of wire, for instance) pass from a usual source of supply under a stationary rod 2 mounted in suitable loom sides or frames 3, 4 and thence over whip rolls 5 pivoted at 6 in the frame and herein shown as held yieldingly by springs 7, there being as many of these whip rolls as the pattern may require or the convenience of the weaver and goods may demand. From these whip rolls the warp strands pass to the front of-the loom over a usual guiding and supporting device, herein shown for convenience as a breast beam 8, to any desired and suitable kind of take-up mechanism, herein shown as comprising a take-up roll 9, guide roll 10 and winding roll 11, the tram of operating mechanism and actuating devices therefor being of the usual kind and therefore not fully shown and not described.  \\n &#39; At a suitable distance back of the fell 12 is mounted a rotary shaft 1.3 on which is keyed a series of winged plates or wheel like separators 14, spaced apart by spacers 15 to receive and properly position the respective warp strands. Pins 16 extend from the spacers radially of the shaft, said pins being herein shown as having four positions or arranged in four series at equal distances apart to correspond to the four steps or succcssive equal movements of the shaft. It will be understood, however, that this arrangement is shown simply to illustrate the general idea. and that the total rotation of the shaft will be, divided into such a number of steps orseparate movements and the number of series of pins or equivalent devices will be correspondirur v varied to suit the requirements or preferences of the weaver within the scope mi the invention. As the shaft is rotated to the :osition shown, tor instance, in Fig. 1, those pins 16 which are thereby raised into upright position serve to lift those warp strands which are engaged by the upright pins, thus forming a shed. The raised warp strands are lifted by the upright pins from the horizontal level of the remaining warp strands, which level constitutes the lower part of the shed and is the normal position of all the warp strands. As herein shown, the innermost give-away whip roll 5 is engaged by all en ga h v those we. strands which are raised by the upright IS 1 as shown in Fig. 1., and yields when these pins raise said warp strands and if. may be considered that the next whip roll 5) engaged by those warp strands which are controlled by the series of pins which s indicated as extending ap proximately horizontally rearward, Fig. 1,  \\n and the next whip roll engaged by those warp strands which are controlled by the downwardly extending; series of pins 13, F1  \\n 1, and theremaining or rearrnost whip r01 as engaged by the warp strands indicated in Fig. 1 as extending approximately horizontally forward from the shaft 13. The pattern. being woven depends upon the position of these pins with reference to the shaft 13 and with reference to each other so that by varying the relative positions of these pins 16, the pattern of the cane weaving may be uli jal. :lv so that a large variety of corni iinutions of diilerent weaves may readily be effected by my loom, and all on the one shaft or in connection with the one shedding and pattern mechanism, as will more fully appear presently-with reference to Figs. 9 and 10. Any suitable driving means for this pattern and shedding mechanism may be provided, being herein shown as comprising a gear 17 on the shaft 13, meshing with a gear 18 secured to a star wheel 19 and loose on a stud 220 projecting from the frame 3. The star wh &#34;fl is driven by engagement with pins 21, 3 of pin wi&#39; &#34;c on a stud 25 and driven by a sprocket to said pin wheel and a chain 27 passing over &amp; sprocket wheel fast on a. cam shaft 29.  \\n  The weft or filling strand iii) of wire or the like derived from any suitable source, as a spool 31, Fig. 2, whence it passes between rotary guides or press rolls mounted at the rear cn-zi of a s ationary hradret 33 steeds laterally .rom the i bracket i3 has a. T-tro We 1, in which a s de block Si is mounted to tra el lengthwise. linmovably held in a projecting car of this slide block is a weft carrier or needle 36. This carrier or needle is best shown in Figs. 1 and 5, where it will be seen that it is tubular or provided with hollow interior 3-7 for receiving the eft strand, 30. open or provided with a longitudinal slot at its upper side, preferably extending to within a short distance of the inner end 39 of the carrier or needle 36, said slot 38 being also preferably, although not necessarily, continuous through out its length. At the inner end 39 of the carrier I provide any suitable meanst&#39;or frictionally engaging and clamping the free forward end of ill. filling strand, herein six-own as comprising an upper spring menu ber 4.0 and a lower member 41, the former preferably having downwardly extending ears 12 at its opposite sides so as to maintain the two springs in alineincnt and prevent the cane or weft strand from slipping out sidewise. The inner gripping surfaces of the s &#39;iring&#39; jaws 10, 41 are preferably providcd with oblique teeth so as to permit free relative movement thereof over the Weft strand in one direction while preventing said movement in the opposite direction. This weft carrier or needle is actuated by any convenient n&#39;icchanisni, being herein shown as coinpri lug a lever 43 having a pin and slotconnection 41 with the block 34 of said carrier at one end and pivoted at 15 to a bracket 16 of the frame 3 at the other end, and actuated by a link 47 and cam lever 48 whose cam roll 49 engages a cam 50 on the cam shaft 29. At the opposite side of the loom, a somewhat similar hollow Weftcarrier or needle 51 is provided, secured in u block ()2 which travels in :r lateral bracket the same in construction as the bracket 33, said block being actuated by a lever 54, link 55 and cam lever 56 whose roll 57 traw els in a path cam 58, all substantially the same as the corresponding parts already described at the opposite side of the loom. The carrier or needle 51 differs from the carrier or needle 36 in having provision for receiving the weft strand from the needle 36, the mechanism provided for this purpose being herein shown as comprising relatively heavyupper and lower spring prws 60 under constant tendency to close. Any snitable means is pi-m lil jil for maintaining these jaws .39. 60 opt-u when going inwardly or toward the left, Fig. 5 and permitting them to be closed when going toward the right, Fig. :2, said means being herein shown as consisting of a cam or spreader 61 pivoted at 62 to the lower jaw 60 and having its upper cam edge in position to en go a pin 63 projecting from theupper jaw 59. Preferably the cam edge of the spreader 61 is shaped adjacent its forward end 64 to be entirely out of engagement. with. the pin 63 when in the position shown in Fig. 5 so as to permit the gripping jaws 59, 60 to exert their extreme gripping tension or pressure on the Weft strand when required to J,  \\n positively to maintain the jaws open so as not to be closed accidentally by vibration or accidental movement. A pin 66 projects latorally from the spreader 6,1 in position to be engaged by the forward end of a projecting finger 67, herein shown as extending rigidly from the front&#39;end 390f the carrier or finger 36, in position to strike the pin 66 j &#39;xst as the needle 51 has arrived into position to engage the free end of the weft strand which projects from the jaws 40, 41  \\n of the needle 36. This permits the jaws 59, 60 to close hard upon said free ends so as to hold the weft strand positively as the needle &#39;51 starts back on its return or Weft-pulling movement. A stop or operating lug 68 projects from the bracket 53 in position to engage the pin 66 at the end of the pulling movement of the needle 51 and thereby restore the cam spreader 61 to spreading position with the pin 63 occupyingthe depresslon 65 so as to open the jaws 59, 60 and keep them open during their return movement to the&#39;left, Fig. 2, for another Weft strand. The jaws 40, 41 are made lighter than the jaws 59, 60 because the resistance of the weft strands 30 tends continually to pull them closed on the inner or drawing movement, Whereas the resistance of said weft strand to the jaws 59, G0 on the drawing movement thereof tends to open said jaws, thus requiring that said jaws 59, 60 shall &#39;be heavier than the jaws 40, 41.  \\n  To sever each transverse strand of filling as it is laid, I preferably provide at the end of the shaft 13 a rotary shear blade or severing device 69, herein shown as having four teeth or cutting. members corresponding to the step movements and shedding operations of the shaft 13 and parts carried thereby) to cotiperate with an under shear blade pivotally mounted on the same shaft 13 and having a rearwardly extending end 71 actuated by a rod or link 72 and cam lever 73 pivoted at 74 to the frame side 3 and having its roll 75 actuated by a path cam 76 on the cam shaft 29.  \\n  Preferably the beating-up operation is accomplished in connection with the rotation of the shaft 13 and by means carried thereby. Said means, as herein shown in this preferred embodiment of the invention,&#39;consists of wings or cam shaped projections 77 projecting from the separators or warp-directing plates 14 and corresponding in number and arrangement to the num ber of series and arrangement of the pins 16, so that as soon as a pick of filling strand has been laid across the loom, the shaft 13 rotates, thereby lowering the shedding pins 16, then in an upright position, and simultaneously turning the upright camwings 77 over forward and downwardly toward the left, Fig. 1,2so as to move the laid strand :of filling gently but positively forward to the fell, the shearing mechanism severing said strand just before the upright wings 77 engage it.  \\n  &#34;It will be understood that the driving mechanism of the loom may be of any usual or preferred kind, a gear wheel 78 being herein shown, Fig. as fast on the outer end of the cam shaft 29 and driven by a gear 7.) on a driving shaft 80 actuated by a driving pulley 81 and belt 82-, the whole under the usual control of a shipper lever 83 and shipper 81.  \\n &#39; At some convenient point, herein shown as just below the drive shaft 80, is a shaft 85 provided with cams 86, 87 for actuating the selvageforming mechanisnr used when the loom is making a wire fabric. This mechanism is shown best in Figs. 9 and 11, the salvage being shown in Fig. 10. Pivotally mounted on inwardly projecting brackets 88 are levers 89, 90 connected by a link 91 to operate in unison, and receiving their movement from a lever 92 pivoted intermediately at 93 on the loom side 4 and connected by a rod 94 to an arm 95 fast on a rock shaft 96 provided with a cam lever 97 whose roll 98 travels in the path of the cam 87. The bending devices proper 99 and 100 are operated respectively by the levers 89, 90 with which they have pin and slot connection, being mounted on pivots 101 in slots formed in lateral flanges 103 which extend forward from the brackets 88. Below these upper bending devices 99, 100 are similar lower bending devices 104, 105 mounted on pivots 106 in slots 107 formed in forwardly projecting flanges 108 of lower brackets 109 corresponding in general construction to the brackets 88. These mech anisms are located at some convenient point between the fell and the breast beam, and the laterally extending flanges or&#39;ledges 103 and 108 serve as guides for the opposite edges of the fabric as clearly shown in Figs. 9 and 11, and also serve toimaintain the proper certainty of position of the edge warp strand and cut ends of the filling which are to form theselvage. The lower bending devices 104, 105 are operated in sub stantially the same way as the upper ones by levers 110, 111 connected by a link 112&#39; and receiving movement from a rod 113 and crank lever 114 pivoted at 115 whose roll 116 travels in the path of the cam 86. The two actuating cams 86, 87 are timed so as to actuate the upper bending devices on one pick and the lower bending devices on the other pick. Each upper bending device is provided with a relatively long bending finger 117 and a short bending finger or clenching finger .118, and each lower bending device is provided with a similar long bending finger 119 and short bending finger or clenchiug member 120. The slots 102, 107 are wide enough for two picks. 2&#39;. a. they have a width to accommodate both the bending finger and the clenching finger of the bending devices, so that when a weft strand comes into alinement with said slots and with the long fingers or preliminary bending fingers 117, 119, the result is that said strand is engaged by one of said fingers, being engaged for instance by the finger 117 if the end of the strand should be bent downwardly to form the selvage, and by the finger 119 if said lie end should be bent upwardly to form the selvage. For instance, in Fig, 10, .l. have shown in dotted lines a, strand. as having been engaged by the finger lit and bent upwardly from the full-line position to the dotted-line position 121 and then engaged by the clenching linger 3.3.8 ef theetlier bending device on the next pick and clenched into a-tight s&#39;elvnge as shown in In other words, each long i1? gives the adjacent cut end of the weft strand e oresov  from the left tow V liminary bend toward the opposite bending device .to a suibcient extent to permit short finger of said oppositebending device toengagc this partially bent wire-end on the next swingingqmovement of said opposite short -finger and thereby crimp down or clench thepartially bent end to its completely bent position. This forms the selvage and makes. a smooth, neat, strong edge. The bending of the Wires is ac-eomplished alternately in opposite directions, as; re qmred by their position alternately above and below&#39;the outermost warp strand or selvage wire,snd saidelternate wrapping 31 position between the separators onpositioning plate-s l-i and err giiging the.respectivewhip rolls 5, and the iveft strand being in. place&#39;in the left hand weft carr er 36, the shaft 113 rotates over forward so es&#39;to&#39; bring one series of lift .ing pins 16 into upright position as shown in-Fig. 1;..thereby correspomlingly lifting those Warp strands which pattern (22125; for according to the pnri icula Wea e or weaves being woven in any W611 fabric.

Meanwhile the same rotary movement of the shaft 131138? lowered the pins 16. thereby restoring the raised warp strands to their normal horizontel-position, where they are maintained taut series of warp&#39;strand s is raised to shed-posi tion by the next or &#34;previouslyxearwardly mately forward horizontal position. soon, as this next selection of warp strands roll,- and the next 4 has been raised bysaid pins to form the next 1 shed. the carriers 36. 51 again she for: ward. the latter grabbing the free end of the strand of filling from the former as the two carriers reach the end oftheir inward movement, and then the carriers at once separate back again aw ay from&#39;each other.  \\n The&#39;cerrier 51 moves back so as to carry the err-use the loom.

By having the needles or carriers arran d to move to the center of the goods an back again, I accomplish a number of advantages. In the first place, the needles themselves are thereby shorter than if they had to move the entire width of the loom and are consequently under better control and the loom is in better balance or shape and capable of more rapid and accurate work and adapted to handle heavier fabrics. In the second place, the weaving is increased at least double, inasmuch as the complete laying of one strand of filling is accomplished in the time required for one needle to move halfway across the loom and back again, as distinguished from requiring the time for a needle to move twice that distance, and moreover the needle-operating mechanisms at both sides &#39;of the loom operate simultaneously and in opposition to each other,  \\n and as the movements are relatively short it is feasible to run the loom at relatively high speed. As already stated, one of the principal objects of my invention is to make it feasible to weave these comparatively unmanageable materials at&#39; relatively high speed, and, besides the features already mentioned as cooperating to this end, another important means for increasing the practicable speed of such weaving residesthe beating-up and the shedding movements in one mechanism wh ch is in combining Instead of the ordinary lav and harness mechanism, the &#39;single&#39;rotarv movementof the shaft 13 simultaneously heats up the weft by the cain wings 77 of said shaft) and lowers the shed (by the pins 16 of said shaft), and at the same time the same rotary movement shears ofi&#39; the end of the wire (by the cooperating blades 69, and furthermore the same rotary movement instantly raises the next shed hv the next set of pins 16 which come up lust as the laid wct&#39;t strand has reached the full. In other words. my mechanism succeeds in a complishing a rapid Weaving movement of such diflicult materials as Wire, cane, etc.. notwithstanding the necessity for strong positive controlling movements thrmlghout all portions of each weaving movement of the loom. The pins 16 (which are preferably although not necessarily formed separately from the spacers 15 and are rectangular in cross section and removablv secured adjacent their free ends to the adjacent separators 14, as by pins 126 which enter holes .127 therein) are provided &#39;for the double purpose of affording a strong positive and quick, yet easy or gradual shedding movement, and at the same time making it possible to produce all the usual varicty of WQZH&#39;ES commonly desired in cane fabrics, etc.. and in Figs. 12 and 13 I ha 1e preferably rotary.  \\n Patent is:  \\n  illustrated some of the various arrangements of weaves possible with this mechanism, notwithstandin that such difficult material is being han ed as, say, cane. Refer-ring to said Figs. 12 and 13, I have indicated at 128 a border of plain weave, followed by a two-and-two twill 129, a thn eand-one twill 130, a coarse-basket weave 131, a mixed or granite weave 132, and a fine basket weave 133. In Fig. 13 I have shown varieties of herringbone effects, a simple, single-point herringbone 134, next to which is a double, blunt-pointed herringbone 135 and then a single, blunt-pointed herringbone 136. These varieties are illustrative merely, to indicate to some extent&#39;the capacity of the pin 16 kind of shedding-pattern control which, while providing the positive and yet gentle and strong operation required, yet affords a wide range of variation. quarters as shown, but this also may be varied. It will be understood that all the weaves shown for instance in Fig. 12, take place simultaneously across the loom and are accomplished in four picks or one revolution of the shaft 13, these variations being due simply to the arrangement of the pins 16, a pin being indicated by each x.  \\n  One object and in fact necessity of the shaft-and-pin shedding mechanism is that thereby it becomes possible to have the shedding mechanismclose to the feil and the heavy warpstrands have a very short lift,- and this lift is at a uniform height for all the strands, so that, notwithstanding the kind of fabric that is being woven, the danger of breaking the strands is practically eliminated. But I do not herein make claim, broadly considered, to the provision, in connection with warp-supporting means, of a series of separators spaced apart to enter between the warp strands and hold them in position to be shedded, and rotary shedding means extending between the separators for lifting and lowering said warp strands in desired order for the shedding operation. as this combination is duly claimed in my Patent N0. 1,067,205, of July 8, 1913.  \\n  Without enumerating at this point those features which I consider broadly novel, I, deem it proper to point out that it will he understood from-the claims that in a number of impprtant respects certain features of my invention are of a broadly novel and pion er character .for this class of weaving.  \\n  Having described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters 1.

WALsH, a citizen of the United States, and resident of Boston, in the county of Suffolk and State of Massachusetts, have invented an Improvement in Looms for \\\\Veaving Cane, &amp;c., of which the following description, in connection with the accompanying drawings, is a specification, like letters on the drawings representing like parts. </p>\\n<p> My invention is a loom specially adapted to weaving coarse fabrics such as are pro duced with cane, willow, wire, etc. </p>\\n<p> Besides providing weaving mechanism capable of handling the coarse, heavy, stiff strands mentioned. one object of my invention is to provide means for accomplishing the weaving rapidly, means having a considerable range of pattern variety, means for facilitating the case of handling the warp strands whereby. for instance, in the shedding operation, they are subjected to a minimum bending strain, and moreover such bending strain as is necessary is an easy strain and not tense. </p>\\n<p> The constructional details of the preferred embodiment of my invention herein contained will appear more fully from the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which I have shown a preferred embodiment of the invention. </p>\\n<p> In the drawings, Figure 1 is a central ver tical longitudinal sectional view of my preferred loom: Fig. I is a detail in side elevation of one of the pattern pins and spacers; Fig. 2 is a view thereof in front elevation; Fig. 3 is a righthand side elevation; Figs. eland 5 are enlarged fragmentary views in top plan and front elevation respectively of the two filling carriers or needles preferably used in the loom, shown in their cooperating position at the middle of the loom or end of their inner throw; Fig. (i is a sectional view showing the pin-wheel drive or lcneva movement in side elevation; Figs. 7 and 8 are devclopn\\'ients of the pe riphery of the respective cams for operating the needles, the former for operating the supply needle and the latter for operating the nipper needle. Fig. 9 is a vertical transverse sectional view showing the selvage mechanism in front elevation; Fig. 10 is an enlarged section of the weave at the selvage; Kg. 11 is a arms-sectional detail on the line Patented Dec. 1, 1914. Serial No. 614,887. </p>\\n<p>11-1l, Fig. 9; and Figs. 12 and 13 are diagrammatic viewsshowmg various combinations of arranging the pins of the pattern mechanism for different weaves. </p>\\n<p> The warp strands 1 (of wire, for instance) pass from a usual source of supply under a stationary rod 2 mounted in suitable loom sides or frames 3, 4 and thence over whip rolls 5 pivoted at 6 in the frame and herein shown as held yieldingly by springs 7, there being as many of these whip rolls as the pattern may require or the convenience of the weaver and goods may demand. From these whip rolls the warp strands pass to the front of-the loom over a usual guiding and supporting device, herein shown for convenience as a breast beam 8, to any desired and suitable kind of take-up mechanism, herein shown as comprising a take-up roll 9, guide roll 10 and winding roll 11, the tram of operating mechanism and actuating devices therefor being of the usual kind and therefore not fully shown and not described. </p>\\n<p>\\' At a suitable distance back of the fell 12 is mounted a rotary shaft 1.3 on which is keyed a series of winged plates or wheel like separators 14, spaced apart by spacers 15 to receive and properly position the respective warp strands. Pins 16 extend from the spacers radially of the shaft, said pins being herein shown as having four positions or arranged in four series at equal distances apart to correspond to the four steps or succcssive equal movements of the shaft. It will be understood, however, that this arrangement is shown simply to illustrate the general idea. and that the total rotation of the shaft will be, divided into such a number of steps orseparate movements and the number of series of pins or equivalent devices will be correspondirur v varied to suit the requirements or preferences of the weaver within the scope mi the invention. As the shaft is rotated to the :osition shown, tor instance, in Fig. 1, those pins 16 which are thereby raised into upright position serve to lift those warp strands which are engaged by the upright pins, thus forming a shed. The raised warp strands are lifted by the upright pins from the horizontal level of the remaining warp strands, which level constitutes the lower part of the shed and is the normal position of all the warp strands. As herein shown, the innermost give-away whip roll 5 is engaged by all en ga h v those we. strands which are raised by the upright IS 1 as shown in Fig. 1., and yields when these pins raise said warp strands and if. may be considered that the next whip roll 5) engaged by those warp strands which are controlled by the series of pins which s indicated as extending ap proximately horizontally rearward, Fig. 1, </p>\\n<p>and the next whip roll engaged by those warp strands which are controlled by the downwardly extending; series of pins 13, F1 </p>\\n<p>1, and theremaining or rearrnost whip r01 as engaged by the warp strands indicated in Fig. 1 as extending approximately horizontally forward from the shaft 13. The pattern. being woven depends upon the position of these pins with reference to the shaft 13 and with reference to each other so that by varying the relative positions of these pins 16, the pattern of the cane weaving may be uli jal. :lv so that a large variety of corni iinutions of diilerent weaves may readily be effected by my loom, and all on the one shaft or in connection with the one shedding and pattern mechanism, as will more fully appear presently-with reference to Figs. 9 and 10. Any suitable driving means for this pattern and shedding mechanism may be provided, being herein shown as comprising a gear 17 on the shaft 13, meshing with a gear 18 secured to a star wheel 19 and loose on a stud 220 projecting from the frame 3. The star wh \"fl is driven by engagement with pins 21, 3 of pin wi\\' \"c on a stud 25 and driven by a sprocket to said pin wheel and a chain 27 passing over &amp; sprocket wheel fast on a. cam shaft 29. </p>\\n<p> The weft or filling strand iii) of wire or the like derived from any suitable source, as a spool 31, Fig. 2, whence it passes between rotary guides or press rolls mounted at the rear cn-zi of a s ationary hradret 33 steeds laterally .rom the i bracket i3 has a. T-tro We 1, in which a s de block Si is mounted to tra el lengthwise. linmovably held in a projecting car of this slide block is a weft carrier or needle 36. This carrier or needle is best shown in Figs. 1 and 5, where it will be seen that it is tubular or provided with hollow interior 3-7 for receiving the eft strand, 30. open or provided with a longitudinal slot at its upper side, preferably extending to within a short distance of the inner end 39 of the carrier or needle 36, said slot 38 being also preferably, although not necessarily, continuous through out its length. At the inner end 39 of the carrier I provide any suitable meanst\\'or frictionally engaging and clamping the free forward end of ill. filling strand, herein six-own as comprising an upper spring menu ber 4.0 and a lower member 41, the former preferably having downwardly extending ears 12 at its opposite sides so as to maintain the two springs in alineincnt and prevent the cane or weft strand from slipping out sidewise. The inner gripping surfaces of the s \\'iring\\' jaws 10, 41 are preferably providcd with oblique teeth so as to permit free relative movement thereof over the Weft strand in one direction while preventing said movement in the opposite direction. This weft carrier or needle is actuated by any convenient n\\'icchanisni, being herein shown as coinpri lug a lever 43 having a pin and slotconnection 41 with the block 34 of said carrier at one end and pivoted at 15 to a bracket 16 of the frame 3 at the other end, and actuated by a link 47 and cam lever 48 whose cam roll 49 engages a cam 50 on the cam shaft 29. At the opposite side of the loom, a somewhat similar hollow Weftcarrier or needle 51 is provided, secured in u block ()2 which travels in :r lateral bracket the same in construction as the bracket 33, said block being actuated by a lever 54, link 55 and cam lever 56 whose roll 57 traw els in a path cam 58, all substantially the same as the corresponding parts already described at the opposite side of the loom. The carrier or needle 51 differs from the carrier or needle 36 in having provision for receiving the weft strand from the needle 36, the mechanism provided for this purpose being herein shown as comprising relatively heavyupper and lower spring prws 60 under constant tendency to close. Any snitable means is pi-m lil jil for maintaining these jaws .39. 60 opt-u when going inwardly or toward the left, Fig. 5 and permitting them to be closed when going toward the right, Fig. :2, said means being herein shown as consisting of a cam or spreader 61 pivoted at 62 to the lower jaw 60 and having its upper cam edge in position to en go a pin 63 projecting from theupper jaw 59. Preferably the cam edge of the spreader 61 is shaped adjacent its forward end 64 to be entirely out of engagement. with. the pin 63 when in the position shown in Fig. 5 so as to permit the gripping jaws 59, 60 to exert their extreme gripping tension or pressure on the Weft strand when required to J, </p>\\n<p>positively to maintain the jaws open so as not to be closed accidentally by vibration or accidental movement. A pin 66 projects latorally from the spreader 6,1 in position to be engaged by the forward end of a projecting finger 67, herein shown as extending rigidly from the front\\'end 390f the carrier or finger 36, in position to strike the pin 66 j \\'xst as the needle 51 has arrived into position to engage the free end of the weft strand which projects from the jaws 40, 41 </p>\\n<p>of the needle 36. This permits the jaws 59, 60 to close hard upon said free ends so as to hold the weft strand positively as the needle \\'51 starts back on its return or Weft-pulling movement. A stop or operating lug 68 projects from the bracket 53 in position to engage the pin 66 at the end of the pulling movement of the needle 51 and thereby restore the cam spreader 61 to spreading position with the pin 63 occupyingthe depresslon 65 so as to open the jaws 59, 60 and keep them open during their return movement to the\\'left, Fig. 2, for another Weft strand. The jaws 40, 41 are made lighter than the jaws 59, 60 because the resistance of the weft strands 30 tends continually to pull them closed on the inner or drawing movement, Whereas the resistance of said weft strand to the jaws 59, G0 on the drawing movement thereof tends to open said jaws, thus requiring that said jaws 59, 60 shall \\'be heavier than the jaws 40, 41. </p>\\n<p> To sever each transverse strand of filling as it is laid, I preferably provide at the end of the shaft 13 a rotary shear blade or severing device 69, herein shown as having four teeth or cutting. members corresponding to the step movements and shedding operations of the shaft 13 and parts carried thereby) to cotiperate with an under shear blade pivotally mounted on the same shaft 13 and having a rearwardly extending end 71 actuated by a rod or link 72 and cam lever 73 pivoted at 74 to the frame side 3 and having its roll 75 actuated by a path cam 76 on the cam shaft 29. </p>\\n<p> Preferably the beating-up operation is accomplished in connection with the rotation of the shaft 13 and by means carried thereby. Said means, as herein shown in this preferred embodiment of the invention,\\'consists of wings or cam shaped projections 77 projecting from the separators or warp-directing plates 14 and corresponding in number and arrangement to the num ber of series and arrangement of the pins 16, so that as soon as a pick of filling strand has been laid across the loom, the shaft 13 rotates, thereby lowering the shedding pins 16, then in an upright position, and simultaneously turning the upright camwings 77 over forward and downwardly toward the left, Fig. 1,2so as to move the laid strand :of filling gently but positively forward to the fell, the shearing mechanism severing said strand just before the upright wings 77 engage it. </p>\\n<p> \"It will be understood that the driving mechanism of the loom may be of any usual or preferred kind, a gear wheel 78 being herein shown, Fig. as fast on the outer end of the cam shaft 29 and driven by a gear 7.) on a driving shaft 80 actuated by a driving pulley 81 and belt 82-, the whole under the usual control of a shipper lever 83 and shipper 81. </p>\\n<p>\\' At some convenient point, herein shown as just below the drive shaft 80, is a shaft 85 provided with cams 86, 87 for actuating the selvageforming mechanisnr used when the loom is making a wire fabric. This mechanism is shown best in Figs. 9 and 11, the salvage being shown in Fig. 10. Pivotally mounted on inwardly projecting brackets 88 are levers 89, 90 connected by a link 91 to operate in unison, and receiving their movement from a lever 92 pivoted intermediately at 93 on the loom side 4 and connected by a rod 94 to an arm 95 fast on a rock shaft 96 provided with a cam lever 97 whose roll 98 travels in the path of the cam 87. The bending devices proper 99 and 100 are operated respectively by the levers 89, 90 with which they have pin and slot connection, being mounted on pivots 101 in slots formed in lateral flanges 103 which extend forward from the brackets 88. Below these upper bending devices 99, 100 are similar lower bending devices 104, 105 mounted on pivots 106 in slots 107 formed in forwardly projecting flanges 108 of lower brackets 109 corresponding in general construction to the brackets 88. These mech anisms are located at some convenient point between the fell and the breast beam, and the laterally extending flanges or\\'ledges 103 and 108 serve as guides for the opposite edges of the fabric as clearly shown in Figs. 9 and 11, and also serve toimaintain the proper certainty of position of the edge warp strand and cut ends of the filling which are to form theselvage. The lower bending devices 104, 105 are operated in sub stantially the same way as the upper ones by levers 110, 111 connected by a link 112\\' and receiving movement from a rod 113 and crank lever 114 pivoted at 115 whose roll 116 travels in the path of the cam 86. The two actuating cams 86, 87 are timed so as to actuate the upper bending devices on one pick and the lower bending devices on the other pick. Each upper bending device is provided with a relatively long bending finger 117 and a short bending finger or clenching finger .118, and each lower bending device is provided with a similar long bending finger 119 and short bending finger or clenchiug member 120. The slots 102, 107 are wide enough for two picks. 2\\'. a. they have a width to accommodate both the bending finger and the clenching finger of the bending devices, so that when a weft strand comes into alinement with said slots and with the long fingers or preliminary bending fingers 117, 119, the result is that said strand is engaged by one of said fingers, being engaged for instance by the finger 117 if the end of the strand should be bent downwardly to form the selvage, and by the finger 119 if said lie end should be bent upwardly to form the selvage. For instance, in Fig, 10, .l. have shown in dotted lines a, strand. as having been engaged by the finger lit and bent upwardly from the full-line position to the dotted-line position 121 and then engaged by the clenching linger 3.3.8 ef theetlier bending device on the next pick and clenched into a-tight s\\'elvnge as shown in In other words, each long i1? gives the adjacent cut end of the weft strand e oresov  from the left tow V liminary bend toward the opposite bending device .to a suibcient extent to permit short finger of said oppositebending device toengagc this partially bent wire-end on the next swingingqmovement of said opposite short -finger and thereby crimp down or clench thepartially bent end to its completely bent position. This forms the selvage and makes. a smooth, neat, strong edge. The bending of the Wires is ac-eomplished alternately in opposite directions, as; re qmred by their position alternately above and below\\'the outermost warp strand or selvage wire,snd saidelternate wrapping 31 position between the separators onpositioning plate-s l-i and err giiging the.respectivewhip rolls 5, and the iveft strand being in. place\\'in the left hand weft carr er 36, the shaft 113 rotates over forward so es\\'to\\' bring one series of lift .ing pins 16 into upright position as shown in-Fig. 1;..thereby correspomlingly lifting those Warp strands which pattern (22125; for according to the pnri icula Wea e or weaves being woven in any W611 fabric.

Meanwhile the same rotary movement of the shaft 131138? lowered the pins 16. thereby restoring the raised warp strands to their normal horizontel-position, where they are maintained taut series of warp\\'strand s is raised to shed-posi tion by the next or \"previouslyxearwardly mately forward horizontal position. soon, as this next selection of warp strands roll,- and the next 4 has been raised bysaid pins to form the next 1 shed. the carriers 36. 51 again she for: ward. the latter grabbing the free end of the strand of filling from the former as the two carriers reach the end oftheir inward movement, and then the carriers at once separate back again aw ay from\\'each other. </p>\\n<p>The\\'cerrier 51 moves back so as to carry the err-use the loom. While the carrier 36. having carried said strand the first half of the distance across the loom; yields up said strand to the csrrier 51 and retreats out of the War in? the succeeding severing\\'and heating;- np operation into position to deliver the next strand of filling. As the successive weaving niovements take place, the take-up Indies and at each step the selvage-mal-:ing mechanism operates to bind the projecting weft wires alternately in opn lif\\' directions tightl around the longitudi n}, 1 his cvcle of, weaving movement/Sis r aw tcmntlcally and with extr rapidmy 60m strand of filling the second half of its travel the fabric forward step by stop.. </p>\\n<p> .extending horizontal series f\\'pi11s a,=; the </p>\\n<p>latter arrive in upright position while. the former upright pins, 16 arrive at approx:- </p>\\n<p> sidering the relatively stifl unmanageable character of the material being woven. By having the needles or carriers arran d to move to the center of the goods an back again, I accomplish a number of advantages. In the first place, the needles themselves are thereby shorter than if they had to move the entire width of the loom and are consequently under better control and the loom is in better balance or shape and capable of more rapid and accurate work and adapted to handle heavier fabrics. In the second place, the weaving is increased at least double, inasmuch as the complete laying of one strand of filling is accomplished in the time required for one needle to move halfway across the loom and back again, as distinguished from requiring the time for a needle to move twice that distance, and moreover the needle-operating mechanisms at both sides \\'of the loom operate simultaneously and in opposition to each other, </p>\\n<p>and as the movements are relatively short it is feasible to run the loom at relatively high speed. As already stated, one of the principal objects of my invention is to make it feasible to weave these comparatively unmanageable materials at\\' relatively high speed, and, besides the features already mentioned as cooperating to this end, another important means for increasing the practicable speed of such weaving residesthe beating-up and the shedding movements in one mechanism wh ch is in combining Instead of the ordinary lav and harness mechanism, the \\'single\\'rotarv movementof the shaft 13 simultaneously heats up the weft by the cain wings 77 of said shaft) and lowers the shed (by the pins 16 of said shaft), and at the same time the same rotary movement shears ofi\\' the end of the wire (by the cooperating blades 69, and furthermore the same rotary movement instantly raises the next shed hv the next set of pins 16 which come up lust as the laid wct\\'t strand has reached the full. In other words. my mechanism succeeds in a complishing a rapid Weaving movement of such diflicult materials as Wire, cane, etc.. notwithstanding the necessity for strong positive controlling movements thrmlghout all portions of each weaving movement of the loom. The pins 16 (which are preferably although not necessarily formed separately from the spacers 15 and are rectangular in cross section and removablv secured adjacent their free ends to the adjacent separators 14, as by pins 126 which enter holes .127 therein) are provided \\'for the double purpose of affording a strong positive and quick, yet easy or gradual shedding movement, and at the same time making it possible to produce all the usual varicty of WQZH\\'ES commonly desired in cane fabrics, etc.. and in Figs. 12 and 13 I ha 1e preferably rotary. </p>\\n<p>Patent is: </p>\\n<p> illustrated some of the various arrangements of weaves possible with this mechanism, notwithstandin that such difficult material is being han ed as, say, cane. Refer-ring to said Figs. 12 and 13, I have indicated at 128 a border of plain weave, followed by a two-and-two twill 129, a thn eand-one twill 130, a coarse-basket weave 131, a mixed or granite weave 132, and a fine basket weave 133. In Fig. 13 I have shown varieties of herringbone effects, a simple, single-point herringbone 134, next to which is a double, blunt-pointed herringbone 135 and then a single, blunt-pointed herringbone 136. These varieties are illustrative merely, to indicate to some extent\\'the capacity of the pin 16 kind of shedding-pattern control which, while providing the positive and yet gentle and strong operation required, yet affords a wide range of variation. quarters as shown, but this also may be varied. It will be understood that all the weaves shown for instance in Fig. 12, take place simultaneously across the loom and are accomplished in four picks or one revolution of the shaft 13, these variations being due simply to the arrangement of the pins 16, a pin being indicated by each x. </p>\\n<p> One object and in fact necessity of the shaft-and-pin shedding mechanism is that thereby it becomes possible to have the shedding mechanismclose to the feil and the heavy warpstrands have a very short lift,- and this lift is at a uniform height for all the strands, so that, notwithstanding the kind of fabric that is being woven, the danger of breaking the strands is practically eliminated. But I do not herein make claim, broadly considered, to the provision, in connection with warp-supporting means, of a series of separators spaced apart to enter between the warp strands and hold them in position to be shedded, and rotary shedding means extending between the separators for lifting and lowering said warp strands in desired order for the shedding operation. as this combination is duly claimed in my Patent N0. 1,067,205, of July 8, 1913. </p>\\n<p> Without enumerating at this point those features which I consider broadly novel, I, deem it proper to point out that it will he understood from-the claims that in a number of impprtant respects certain features of my invention are of a broadly novel and pion er character .for this class of weaving. </p>\\n<p> Having described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters 1.

FISHER, JR., OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.  \\n MALT-KILN.  \\n SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 271,184, dated January 23,. 1883. Application filed December 15, 1882. (No model.)  \\n To alt whom it may concern:  \\n  Be it known thatI, HENRYALTENBRAND, of Brooklyn, Kings county, New York, have invented certain Improvements in Malt-Kilns, of which the following is a specification.  \\n  My invention consists in&#39; means, fully described hereinafter, whereby to create and maintain a continuous current of hot air from the furnace to the upper outlet of a malt-kiln, so as to rapidly extract and expel the moisture from the malt.  \\n  In the drawings, Figure l is a sectional elevation of a kiln, showing my invention; and Fig. 2 is a section showing a modification.  \\n  In Letters Patent granted to me April 17, 1877, I describe an apparatus for drying malt in which a blower anda perforated pipe are used to create a current of hot air and conduct it to the floors.  \\n  My present invention consists in means whereby to impart movement to such a body of heated air that it is carried directly from the furnace through the successivetloors ofa malthouse without the necessary intervention of anypipes or conduits, and wherebyI avoid the objectionstotheeinploymentofablower,which, by condensing the air and forcing it through the floors in a denser condition, prevents it from absorbing and carrying off the moisture to the extent it otherwise would.  \\n  In place of carrying the heated air from the furnace A by means of pipes leading to the different floors, I permit the heated air to flow directly into the chamber X below the lower perforated floor, A, of the malt-house O, and instead of using a blower for forcing the air upward from the lower compartment I place an exhaust-fan, D, so as to draw air from one of the upper outlets above the upper floor, so that the air is rarefied, and is carried in a rarefied condition from the furnace through the perforations of the successive floors, and finally expelled through the opening above the fan. By this means I not only avoid the expense incident to the use of long conducting tubes, but I further avoid localizing the currents, distribute the air over the whole floor, and lift the grain throughout the entire extent of the floors, carrying the air through rapidly, so that there can be little or no condensation of moist- 5o ure, and the latter is rapidly absorbed into the upflowing currents and carried away from the grain.  \\n The lifting of the grain by the upflowing currents of air renders unnecessary the em but is effected without mashing or injuring the particles, liable to result when mechanical means are employedfor stirring. Moreover, the whole body of grain on the rectangular floors is stirred, whereas with ordinary stirrers having a circular sweep the corner portions are not affected.  \\n  The use of an exhaust apparatus for lifting the grain is important, for it has been found that an exhaust has a much better effect than a blower, as when the air is propelled from below it will seek the easiest passage out and loses force from leakage in the walls, 850., whereas when an exhaust is arranged above the floors the air is drawn through every portion of the floors, and slight leaks have no detrimental effect.  \\n  I am aware that it is not new to pass grain, &amp;c., in drying over perforated screens through and over which hot air is carried, and that exhaust-fans. are used for this purpose as well as for drawing air over grain upon malt-floors, and I do not claim broadly the use of an exhaust in a malt-house, myinvention being distinguished by the fact that I dispense with mechanical stirrers, and secure the desired rapid drying effect by lifting and stirring the grain by an upward current produced by an exhaust apparatus.  \\n The exhaust-fan can be arranged horizontally in the opening below the cupola, as shown in 0 Fig, 1; or two fans upon one shaft, (1, may be arranged in opposite openings in the vertical walls of the cupola; or any other desirable arrangement may be adopted. For instance, the  \\n fan may be placed in one of the upper windows 5 or in a conduit leading to one of the upper outlets.  \\n It will be evident that any suitable exhaust device (ejector or other appliance) may be substituted for the exhaust-fan.  \\n I claim- 1. The withindescribed improvement in drying malt, the same consisting in drawing currents of Warm air upward through the body of malt in such manner as to lift and separatethe particles thereof. v  \\n 2. The combination, with the perforated floors 10 of a malt-house and with the furnace thereof,  \\n of an exhaust apparatus communicating with the space above the upper floor, and constructed and provided with operating mechanism, as set forth, whereby the air above the malt is rarefied, and the particles of malt are lifted and separated by and exposed to rapidlyascending warm-air currents, as specified.  \\n  In testimony whereof I have hereunto set nay-hand in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.  \\n  HENRY AL&#39;IIEINBRANT).
