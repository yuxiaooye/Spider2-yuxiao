# Spider 2.0-Lite

To align with research interests in **traditional Text2SQL settings**, we released Spider 2.0-Lite. This set is more self-contained, with well-prepared database metadata and documentation, making it a text-in, text-out task that supports faster development and evaluation.


## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Download  [local database](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1hZq4Jsx0Gj0bhstrViNF_nbo6Qh6slER&export=download&authuser=0), unzip and put all the `.sqlite` files into directory `spider2-lite/resource/databases/spider2-localdb`.

2. Usage.
- If your method doesn't require dynamic interaction with the databases, you can make full use of the data in the [`databases`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/databases) and the content in the [`documentation`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/documentation).
- If your method requires dynamic interaction with the database, in addition to these, you can use the scripts in the [`interface`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/interface) to interact with the cloud database.

In addition, if you want to view the data in more detail, you need to register for a BigQuery account. Here is a [Bigquery Guideline](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/assets/Bigquery_Guideline.md).

The file `spider2-lite_0930.json` is an older version, while `spider2-lite.json` is the latest version. To address the high query costs associated with large datasets, we have sampled certain tables from `bigquery-public-data` and `patent-public-data` into `spider2-public-data`, making development more efficient and convenient.

## Data Content and Format

Each file in `spider2-lite.json` contains the following fields:
- `instance_id`: the unique example id
- `db`: the database id to which this question is addressed
- `question`: the natural language question
- `external_knowledge`: the filenames of external knowledge, documentation, and information required to answer this question are stored in documents
- 
The [`databases`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/databases) and the content in [`documentation`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/resource/documentation) are resources you can use when benchmarking methods.



```
{
    "instance_id": "ga010",
    "db": "bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce",
    "question": "Can you give me an overview of our website traffic for December 2020? I'm particularly interested in the channel with the fourth highest number of sessions.",
    "external_knowledge": "ga4_dimensions_and_metrics.md"
}
```

The gold SQLs are shown in [evaluation_suite/gold/sql](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/evaluation_suite/gold/sql).



## Evaluation

We create [evaluation suite](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/evaluation_suite) for Spider 2.0-Lite.
